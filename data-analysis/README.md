#### [Mapping the meanings of decarbonisation: A systematic review of studies in the social sciences using lexicometric analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266678942100057X)

**Method**
> We ran several different analyses. First, we applied descriptive statistics
> to the bibliometric data associated with the papers selected. Then,
> we conducted separate lexicometric analyses (word counts, word usage
> over time, similarity analysis, lexical correspondence analysis) on the
> two datasets of keywords and titles, which generated similar results. To
> avoid redundancies, only some outputs are reported here.
> 
> 3.2.1. Bibliometric indexes
> We examined the number of articles published by the journals
> involved in our dataset (both in absolute terms, and weighted by each
> journal's total number of publications in the years considered) and the
> number of citations they received.
> 
> 3.2.2. Key terms and their use over time
> We examined the most often used terms to obtain a first set of
> buzzwords and hot topics. To identify emerging trends, we measured the
> frequency over time of the most often-used words weighted by the total
> number of words in our dataset for each year considered.
> 
> 3.2.3 Similarity analysis
> We used a similarity analysis to map the co-occurrences of key terms
> (i.e., how many times certain words appeared close to one another). This
> analysis sheds light on the main themes pertaining to decarbonisation.
> 
> 3.2.4. Lexical correspondence analysis
> Lexical correspondence analysis was used to create a map of the
> research field by representing the relations between themes and variables
> (years, and the journals most often present). This analytical approach
> enabled us to obtain a graphical representation of the content year by
> year in the six journals focusing the most on the topic of decarbonisation.

**Note regarding word context**
> Looking at the trends of the five keywords used the most (>17 times)
> during the years considered (Fig. 4), some tendencies seem to emerge.
> We excluded the word “coal” because it is the only one that is not a
> multiword and, without its lexical context, it is not sufficiently
> explanatory.
