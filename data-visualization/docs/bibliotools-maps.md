> [!NOTE]
> - **BiblioTools** refers to a pythonic command line scripts for creating maps of bibliographic data
> - **BiblioMaps** is a web interface for BiblioTools


## General notes
- no license? But the following is mentioned
  > - Download the software and use it on your data.
  > - Download the software and edit / improve / expand the code as you see fit, if you are a motivated developper.
- BiblioMaps does not yet have a citation but BiblioTools does: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-011-0482-y
- No longer under development? No major updates since March 2018 according to main website
- Visualizations are done with d3.js
  - Graphs allow for dynamic and static positioning of nodes
  - Pie/bar charts and plots all have mousover tooltips
  - A repeatable structure is attempted for all types of data visualizations
    - This would maximise reuse of code and homogenize the user experience
    - This may not be applicable for every data visualization use-case

## Requirements
- Requires [WebOfScience](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/) (WoS) and/or [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri) access which are available through **UCBL (SESAME) credentials**
  - See [this tutorial](https://www.sebastian-grauwin.com/bibliomaps/tutorials.html#EXT) for general instructions on data exportation
  - This tutorial may be slightly out of date. E.g., in the WoS instruction reference to "Output records" which is now labled "Export".
- No binary installer or executable, requires Python and command line to run
  - Installation instructions are available [here](https://www.sebastian-grauwin.com/bibliomaps/download.html)
- Minimal management of script input/output and local/public server hosting is also required for BiblioMaps data visualization

## Technical limitations
- [WebOfScience](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/) and [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri) data is exported/imported manually

## Installation notes
- Results are stored under the [./data/bibliotools](./data/bibliotools) folder following the instructions mentioned in the [requirements section](#requirements)
  - BiblioTools3.2 is installed in [./BibioTools3.2](./BiblioTools3.2/) for the purposes of this documentation.
  - An initial [WoS export](./data/bibliotools/rawdata/WoS_export.txt) (56 results) is used for this using this WoS query: `ALL=(City) AND ALL=(Durable) AND ALL=(Building) AND (ALL=(Innovative) OR ALL=(Innovation))`
- BiblioTools rejects "inadequate" records (e.g., missing publication year) by default
- BiblioMaps server files are stored in [./data/bibliotools/server/](./data/bibliotools/server/) following the tutorial linked in the BiblioMaps documentation.

Using a terminal with the same working directory as this document the following commands are run:
```bash
python BiblioTools3.2/all_in_one.py -i data/bibliotools/rawdata -o data/bibliotools/
# For this test answer 'y' to user input and '1' for cluster sizes when prompted
# Once the json/gephi files are extracted at the publication level input 'n' to end the script 
python BiblioTools3.2/biblio_coupling.py -i data/bibliotools -v
cp -r BiblioTools3.2/BIBLIOMAPS_myprojectname/* data/bibliotools/server
cp -r data/bibliotools/freqs data/bibliotools/server/data
cp -r data/bibliotools/jsonfiles/* data/bibliotools/server/data
```

To run a localhost server with python:
```bash
python -m http.server -d data/bibliotools/server/
```

Navigate to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see the visualization


> [!IMPORTANT]
> To have access to Bibliographic Coupling at the publication level, uncomment line 14 of the [headermenu.html](./data/bibliotools/server/headermenu.html) file.
> This page will be accessible from [localhost:8000/BCpublis.html](http://localhost:8000/BCpublis.html)
> Also, a syntax error was found in the file [network_all_defaultVAR.json](./data/bibliotools/server/data/network_all_defaultVAR.json).
> The `"DefinedPos"` value should be corrected to a 2D array using the following structure: 
> ```json
> "DefinedPos":[[0,20.00,10.00], [1,15.40,18.41], [25,19.91,8.68], [28,0.37,12.71], [13,19.07,14.20], [24,14.24,0.94], [46,5.68,19.02], [35,0.96,5.72], [41,0.13,8.41]]
> ```
> (Note that the 2D array values may be different when recalculated)

## Visualization notes

Three main pages are provided:
1. [Corpus description](#Corpus-description)
2. [BC (Bibliographic Coupling) Clusters](#bc-bibliographic-coupling-clusters)
3. [BC Network](#BC-Network)

### Corpus description

Displays general data visualizations of the corpus data.

All visualizations display some specialized data visualization on the right, and a table with the raw data in the middle of the interface.
This table can always be sorted by `Record count` or alphabetically by `Item` (record name)

### BC (Bibliographic Coupling) Clusters

Groups records into topics (clusters) and subtopicsbased on the shared references between records, then provides basic statistical analysis of each topic.
- Topics are visualized through a Graph :spider_web:
  - Node size represents the number of records in the topic
  - Link thickness represents the similarity between two topics 
- The following topic data are visualized through tables:
  - most frequent keywords
  - most subject subject categories
  - most frequent journal sources
  - most frequent countries
  - most frequent references
  - most frequent references' sources
  - most representative papers
  - most cited authors
- The following topic data are visualized through a bar chart
  - number of publications per year and if a year had above or below the average number of publications

> This seems to be because the `awesomplete.js` file is loaded asyncronously (see line 11 of the [BCpublis.html](data\bibliotools\server\BCpublis.html) file).
> Reloading the page after a few minutes sometimes fixes this issue.

### BC Network

Similar to [BC Clusters](#bc-bibliographic-coupling-clusters) but for individual records/publications without clusterization.
Little statistical analysis is displayed besides visualizing which records have attributes in common.
Records with common attribues are linked.
The following data are display for each record:
- authors
- keywords
- subject(s)
- journal
- type (article, conference proceedings, etc.)
- publication year
- country
- references
