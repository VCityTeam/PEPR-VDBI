50	Partial funding from the Boeing Company is gratefully acknowledged via the Boeing/Sandia CRADA SC02/1651.14.00. Funding from the Fuel Cell Market Transformation Program (led by Pete Devlin) at the U.S. DOE Fuel Cell Technologies Office was critical, making the broader and stronger development project possible, and specifically allowing the construction and field testing of five additional H<INF>2</INF>LT units. In addition to funding, we appreciate the encouragement of Pete and his colleagues Nancy Garland and John Christensen in the Market Transformation program. Special thanks to Sunita Satyapal at DOE for supporting this work. The authors thank Tien Nguyen of DOE for providing an analysis of GHG emissions for the H<INF>2</INF>LT technology, with the hydrogen derived from either steam reforming of natural gas, or wind-based electrolysis of water.; The project would not have been successful without the participation of Caltrans. We thank Randy Iwasaki, former director of Caltrans, for providing wonderful encouragement and support of the work in its early phases, and offering resources of the Division of Research and Innovation at Caltrans (under the direction of Larry Orcutt) to be applied in support of the project. Larry Orcutt directed Nancy Chinlund of Caltrans to become involved. Nancy was very proactive in launching the project from a Caltrans perspective, which led directly to Randy Woolley's involvement in the project. The Caltrans partners aggressively challenged the project to build a prototype in a few months' time to be shown at the 2009 AASHTO meeting.; Caltrans provided considerable in-kind support through the donation of its own technical expertise and through its support of the U.C. Davis AHMCT for characterizing the lighting options for the H<INF>2</INF>LT as well as supervising the Caltrans District 3 field test. We acknowledge the contributions of Gonzalo Gomez of Caltrans for discussions of lighting technology options for the H<INF>2</INF>LT. Ben Creed, Lauren Miller, Sean Donohoe and Matt Jones at U.C. Davis provided many hours of night work characterizing the illumination provided by the candidate plasma, LED and MH lighting options. In a related activity, Ty Larson of Boeing performed checks that the glass covering the plasma lights was sufficiently absorbing UV radiation, which was very helpful.; The staff at Saunders Electric, including Ron Brewer, Frank Soggiu and Pat Hess were instrumental in the 3-year field tests of the Alpha and Beta H<INF>2</INF>LT units used for the Los Angeles entertainment award shows and elsewhere in the entertainment industry.; The field test of the unit at the NASA KSC was an excellent example of cooperation between government agencies. We thank Chuck Griffin for providing local supervision of the project from the NASA KSC end, along with a lot of help from Melissa Clevenger of the propellants group and Ray Davis from operations. The KSC staff were extremely professional and helpful. We thank Pattie Lewis Burford (ITB Inc.) and Jerry Curran (EASI) for providing corrosion inspection of the Beta unit that was field tested at the NASA KSC for a year, and Randy Morris for extensive coordination.; Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.
