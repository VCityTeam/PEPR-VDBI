0	The literature views many African cities as dysfunctional with a hodgepodge of land uses and poor "connectivity." One driver of inefficient land uses is construction decisions for highly durable buildings made under weak institutions. In a novel approach, we model the dynamics of urban land use with both formal and slum dwellings and ongoing urban redevelopment to higher building heights in the formal sector as a city grows. We analyze the evolution of Nairobi using a unique high-spatial resolution data set. The analysis suggests insufficient building volume through most of the city and large slum areas with low housing volumes near the center, where corrupted institutions deter conversion to formal sector usage.
1	We model the building of a city, estimate parameters of the model, and calculate welfare losses from institutional frictions encountered in changing land-use. We distinguish formal and slum construction technologies; in contrast to slums, formal structures can be built tall, are durable, and non-malleable. As the city grows areas are initially developed informally, then formally, and then redeveloped periodically. Slums are modelled as a technology choice; however, institutional frictions in land markets may hinder their conversion to formal usage that requires secure property rights. Using unique data on Nairobi for 2003 and 2015, we develop a novel set of facts that support assumptions of the model, estimate all parameters of the model, and calculate welfare losses of conversion frictions. We track the dynamic evolution of the city and compare it with model predictions. In the core city formal sector, about a third of buildings were torn down over 12 years and replaced by buildings on average three times higher. For slums in older areas near the centre, even after buying out slumlords, overcoming institutional frictions would yield gains amounting to about 18,000 per slum household, thirty times typical annual slum rent payments.
2	Theoretical treatments of new industry formation within the inner city emphasise the significance of agglomeration economies, social relations, institutional factors, and representational (semiotic) features of the landscape. The author contributes to a larger understanding of generative processes of industrial innovation in the urban core by demonstrating through theoretical synthesis and case studies, the critical roles played by 'material' (or physical) space and form. First, Soja's idea of the 'industry-shaping power of spatiality' in the new economic spaces of the post-Fordist metropolis is interpreted as the boundedness of inner-city space, the intimacy of urban landscapes, and the integrity of urban form. Second, the cogency of Helbrecht's injunction regarding the complementarity of abstractive and 'concrete' dimensions of urban space in knowledge-based industry clusters is demonstrated by case-study references situated in London, Vancouver, and Singapore. Third, the author draws on Markus's incisive analysis of principal building types (and 'durable taxonomies' of building function and social meaning) to link historic and contemporary industrialisation processes, including the comingling of production, housing, and consumption. The nexus of theoretical integration lies in the articulation of three-dimensional industrial landscapes comprised of physical space and form as well as symbolic constructs.
3	We develop a model to study the impact of changes in price sensitivity on the firm as it introduces multiple generations of a durable product where unit costs are a convex function of quality. We incorporate the psychological processes of sensitization and habituation into a model of discretionary purchasing of replacement products motivated by past experience. When price sensitivity decreases with each purchase (sensitization), the myopic firm offers a higher quality product at a much higher price with each generation. When price sensitivity increases with each purchase (habituation), the myopic firm engages in price skimming. When sensitization is followed by habituation, the myopic firm eventually provides higher quality than the market is willing to pay for, leading to a steep drop-off in sales and profits. The actions of the forward-looking firm depend on the discount rate. A firm with a low discount rate builds its customer base before offering a higher quality and higher priced product. In contrast, a firm with a high discount rate quickly increases price and quality following the same path to falling profits of the myopic firm. These results provide insight into the firm and consumer behaviors underlying the phenomenon of "performance oversupply" identified in the innovation literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

4	The sustainable city of the future is typically envisioned as smart, creative and disruptive, assuming that urban and local sustainability is achieved through new technology and innovation. However, considering that the built environments of our cities and surroundings are highly durable, there is also a need to focus on how resources brought from the past - histories, artefacts and places - may be used for promoting urban sustainability. We label this a "deep city" perspective on urban and local transformation. By looking at Roros, a World Heritage Site in central Norway with a dense and historic wooden urban centre, we investigate how its heritage protection facilitates the maintenance of a compact urban centre. We hold that a shared sense of place - the deepness- may serve as a resource against unsustainable sprawl and mall-oriented development.
5	Architecture has always provided an opportunity for change. It is difficult to establish how and when it adheres to the logic of trend or else makes up an element of change interpreted as a strategic phenomenon. The phases which have characterized the present lay-out of cities and the morphology of their constitutive elements are recognizable moments of the architectural, technological and cultural approach to building. They provide in fact the comprehensive picture of the cultural attitude of the figures involved in the processes of modification of reality, the context on which we are called to act being difficult to interpret and subject to constant and rapid change. The contemporary city appears to be fragmented into systems, fabrics and nodes, and several partial cities can be identified within. In the network society, there is the emergence of original forms and relationships of space which make it necessary to reformulate the planning, building and management of the land and its architectural expressions. The traditional city model divided into parts and functions is today replaced by the "multiple city", a not only multifunctional but also complex node where local and global networks intertwine. There are, in fact, some places in the city which can provide variable and dynamic responses to the ever changing demands and expectations of users, which are precisely interpreted as city users. In this arena, the relationship between architecture, town planning, design, new technologies and materials borrowed for architectural purposes, takes shape as one of the great issues of our contemporary era. We are witnessing the coexistence of opposed, even extreme, design approaches. On the one hand, they are aimed at reaffirming the historical and traditional building paradigms by re-proposing opaque, heavy, ancient, preexisting and eternal features which the establishment architecture has always promoted. On the other hand, they tend to interpret the increasingly intangible connotations of development that our society is adopting as elements of daily life, by absorbing the principles of transparency, innovation, lightness, modernity, speed, security, temporariness as instruments conveying an increasingly ethereal and dynamic thought. Ephemeral, changeable and recyclable materials are the best interpreters of the present reversal in trend. In the past, it was the great services which were the well-established symbols implemented through materials and technologies aimed to last, whereas ordinary and residential building was expressed with sobriety and technological simplicity, i.e. qualities achieved through non durable building systems, but aimed to focus their existence on their social and functional role. Today the opposite phenomenon is true: residential housing is now the very icon of eternity and the "contemporary monument" is designed to represent a moment, an historical fragment of short duration. Hence, observations relating to some new "moments" of contemporary building have emerged and raised real issues with which the present architectural culture should be put to the test. To formulate observations, we shall proceed by the opposition of dualities. Supporting one or the other position does not only involve making a simple nominal choice but, first, it moves the conditioning created by the individual practice and, then translates into the definition of a representative style of its time. The universe of concepts, included within the five theme families proposed, represents the theoretical and constituent themes characterizing a particular time, taste and method. That which is proposed below is not a dichotomic vision of the process, which defines architecture according to its general constitutive elements, but rather an analysis of the state of the art of the architectural subject and practice, developed through the differential analysis of items which are opposed in terms of methods and products.
6	Managing landfill waste is essential to sustainable resource utilization. With a focus on the luxury fashion industry, this paper highlights the role that sustainable and social innovations can play in reducing environmental waste and improving social outcomes. Elvis & Kresse is a purpose-driven case study, because it was founded to eradicate a problem that had thus far received little attention, namely the problem of disposing of end-of-life fire-hoses. From a business model and circular economy perspective, this article explains how the company's rescue-transform-donate model has helped to build a sustainable and socially oriented yet profitable luxury brand. The analysis of the case suggests that for scholars, the typical business model canvas merits some revision beyond the current business focus on the financial bottom line to account for the social and ethical dimensions. For practitioners, this case demonstrates how the circular economy can be compatible with luxury fashion by turning waste into durable, fashionable products.
7	Since the second half of the nineteenth century, scientists and literary figures alike have focused on the decay of Venice, the former surveying the damage, the latter describing its charm, both recommending proper preservation. Over time, the growth of mass tourism and the city's economic development has brought about social, urban and architectural transformations, causing a marked decline in both the local population and in craftsmanship. Loss of knowledge of traditional building skills subsequently led to irreversible low-quality interventions in which historical surfaces have been progressively replaced by non-durable plasters. The main reason for this project is to create synergy between the University IUAV in Venice (Istituto Universitario di Architettura di Venezia) and Venice's local craftsmen through which traditional 'construction wisdom' can once again come to the fore. The project seeks to enhance the expertise of artisans and the use of historical materials to care for the city, respecting its 'material culture' while simultaneously addressing sustainable innovation. It is focused on the preservation of Venice through thorough and continuous maintenance that can control - and possibly lessen - improper architectural changes and develop a broader sensibility towards the authenticity of materials, both in monuments and simple artifacts. It improves education by enabling older custodians of traditional knowledge to transfer it to the younger generation which will have the duty of preserving Venice's future.
8	The city of Johannesburg offers insights into urban governance and the interesting interplay between managing the pressures in a rapidly urbanizing context, with the political imperatives that are enduring challenges. The metropolitan municipality of Johannesburg (hereafter Johannesburg), as it is known today, represents one of the most diverse cities in the African continent. That urbanization, however, came up hard against the power of the past. Areas zoned by race had been carved into the landscape, with natural and manufactured boundaries to keep formerly white areas 'safe' from those zoned for other races. Highways, light industrial plant, rivers and streams, all combined to ensure the Johannesburg landscape are spatially disfigured, and precisely because it is built into the landscape, the impact of apartheid has proved remarkably durable. Urban growth is concentrated in Johannesburg's townships and much of it is class driven: the middle class (of all races) is increasingly being found in cluster and complexes in the north Johannesburg, while poor and working-class African and coloured communities in particular are densifying in the south. The racial and spatial divisions of the city continue to pose fundamental challenges in terms of governance, fiscal management and spatially driven service delivery.
9	This article reports on a research project, Leeds City Lab, that brought together partner organizations to explore the meanings and practices of co-production in the context of urban change. Our intention is to offer a response to the crisis in urban governance by combining the growing academic and practitioner debates on co-production and urban laboratories in order to explore radically different institutional personae that can respond to deficits in contemporary urban governance, especially relating to participation and disenfranchisement, and ultimately unlock improved ways of designing, managing and living in cities. Our analysis has identified four key ways in which co-production labs can recast urban governance to more progressive ends: by moving beyond traditional organizational identities and working practices, embracing grey spaces of new civic interfaces, foregrounding emotions and power and committing to durable solutions. Ultimately, what we point towards is that urban governance can be more effectively enacted in co-production labs that bring together universities and the public, private and civil society sectors on a basis of equality, trust and openness. These spaces have the potential to unlock a city's knowledge, resources and assets, to unpack complex challenges and to build capacity to deliver improved city-wide solutions.
10	Passive radiative cooling strategy shows a great potential in mitigating global warming and reducing energy consumption. However, existing radiative coolers generally show poor solar-reflection and be easily dampened by environmental aging, making the cooling ineffective. Mimicking the biological design for thermoregulation has given promise for realizing high performance and long time cooling. Here, inspired by structural whiteness in butterflies, we developed a sustainable cellulose nanocrystal aerogel grating (CAG) with designable metasurfaces for efficient radiative cooling, which can be achieved by using copper meshes as well as manipulating the 2D confined freeze casting process. The simulation indicates that the regular tubes and irregular gully on the aerogel surface act as gratings to achieve diffraction and broadband reflection of sunlight. Such CAG exhibits ultrahigh solar reflectance (97.4 %), high infrared emittance (94 %), and anti environmental aging function (anti-ultraviolet light/ contamination). It achieves a sub-ambient temperature drop of 10.5 degrees C under direct sunlight and still approximately 9.4 degrees C even after 6 months of exposure to hot weather. Building simulations demonstrate that CAG can save 47 % of the worldwide energy consumption for cooling each year. This work provides insight into the design of bioinspired thermal-regulating materials to save energy consumption.
11	The need to protect our cultural heritage was stressed upon by "The Leipzig Chart for Durable European Cities", a European Community act, which appeared in 2007 in response to the danger of destruction of European city centres. This was the first official act that recognizes the historical centres as Europe's research, innovation, and economical development engines and one of its main goals was to attract investments and activities in the cities centres through the citizens' participation while putting an end to the limitless extension of the cities. The danger facing not only Romanian cities but most European ones as well, is loss of their centrality directly through neglect, abandonment of the central areas, gradual taking over of the public space by private use, or indirectly as a consequence of the territorial urbanization in any point of the region, by decentralizing living, commerce and office areas. The centralizing strategy applied in the case of the city of Timisoara, to the central areas took place on three levels, namely: revitalize - restructure - renovation in this order by using the potential of the existing students as an engine of development. The revitalization itself took place on another three levels meaning refunctionalizing of buildings, recreating public spaces and reorienting events. The relationship between the central historical area and the universities around it make it ideal for housing student spin outs, major generators of innovation and forming knowledge centres or creative hubs which are not only promising growth industries but also as catalysts for urban regeneration, which goes beyond physical regeneration as urban knowledge hubs are developed with explicit social regeneration objectives in mind. Without a well made strategy, its profound understanding by the local authorities and its coherent application, the city's public urban areas may collapse despite funds, creative efforts, dedication and expertise invested in their rehabilitation.

12	Since the dawn of history concrete has been, right behind stone and brick, one of the oldest building materials. The ancient Romans took advantage of its opportunities. They constructed amazing architectural objects, which survived centuries as whole buildings or parts of them. Concrete is so ubiquitous, that when we are walking in a newer districts of cities we are virtually surrounded by concrete from everywhere. Sometimes we do not realize in how many cases and various ways concrete is used in towns and cities. As we know, human curiosity and quest for newer and newer solutions and capabilities does not leave such amazing material as concrete alone. There are many varieties of concrete, depending on what people want to achieve. By changing its chemical composition, technological process and adding various other materials, we receive various types of concrete. We use them to create durable supporting structures, a variety of concrete which is resistant to constant moisture or different chemical types. Additionally, some aspects of aesthetics in architecture are made with the help of concrete.
13	Numerous calls at national and international level are leading some countries to seek to redesign the provision of healthcare and services. Care pathways have the potential to improve outcomes by providing a mechanism to coordinate care and reduce fragmentation and ultimately costs. However, their implementation still shows variable results, resulting in them being considered as complex interventions in complex systems. By mobilizing an emerging approach combining action research and grounded theory methodology, we conducted a pilot project on care pathways. We used a strongly inductive process, to mobilize comparison and continuous theoretical sampling to produce theories. Forty-two interviews were conducted, and participant observations were made throughout the project, including 60 participant observations at meetings, workshops and field observations. The investigators kept logbooks and recorded field notes. Thematic analysis was used with an inductive approach. The present model explains the factors that positively or negatively influence the implementation of innovations in care pathways. The model represents interactions between facilitating factors, favourable conditions for the emergence of innovation adoption, implementation process enablers and challenges or barriers including those related specifically to the local context. What seems to be totally new is the embodiment of the mobilizing shared objective of active patient-partner participation in decision-making, data collection and analysis and solution building. This allows, in our opinion, to transcend professional perspectives for the benefit of patient-oriented results. Finally, the pilot project has created expectations in terms of spread and scaling. Future research on care pathway implementation should go further in the evaluation of the multifactorial impacts and develop a methodological framework of care pathway implementation, as the only existing proposition seems limited. Furthermore, from a social science perspective, it would be interesting to analyse the modes of social valuation of the different actors to understand what allows the transformation of collective action.
14	The results of investigations on deteriorations of existing concrete structures all over Japan were presented. An accident that occurred in a tunnel lining concrete was the starting point. Measures to make structures durable were proposed based on the results. These measures are also presented in this paper. At that time Japan Society of Civil Engineers published a performance based construction specification. The specification is an initiative work to specify the methods to achieve structures with desired performances with not only safety and serviceability but also durability. The main part of the Specification is the method to investigate durability of structures. Introduction of this specification is also the objective of this paper.
15	Nowadays, high-pressure sensors are broadly utilized in manufacturing and applications for ensuring safe production and preventing failures. However, present high-pressure sensors are mainly fabricated by high-strength metal and cement, which are too heavy or easy-corrosive to satisfy long-term usage. Polymer piezoresistive materials have great potential due to their stability and light weight, but achieving high strength and durability at the same time remains a serious challenge. In this work, a high-strength pressure sensor is fabricated by epoxy resin/carbon fiber (EP/CF) composite, where CF builds a conductive network as a reinforcing phase and EP provides a durable and light-weight base phase. The conductive mechanism based on stress-induced structure has been elucidated, and the performance of related sensors in various conditions is revealed. The lightweight (-1.28 g/cm(3)) pressure sensor manifests a wide sensing response range from 22 kPa to 80 MPa. Moreover, the durability of this novel pressure sensor is verified by repeating loading and unloading at a high pressure of 10 MPa for more than 3500 cycles. Meanwhile, the high temperature and water resistance are furtherly confirmed, where EP/CF composites exhibits excellent cycling stability (10 MPa, >1000 cycles) after heating (100 C-degrees) or soaking in water. Attributed to the comprehensive performance of high-strength, ultrawide detection range, durability and light weight, EP/CF composites are applied for road safety monitoring and deep-sea operation, showing wide application prospects in high-pressure monitoring field.
16	Production technologies of Roman to Medieval times bricks on the city of Padua were addressed by means of a multi-analytical approach, consisting in Spectrophotometry, X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), Powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD), Polarized Optical Microscopy (POM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEMEDS). The Early-Christian (5-6th centuries) and Romanesque (12-13th centuries) areas of the Basilica of Saint Justine of Padua (5/6-16th centuries), and the remains of the Roman necropolis (1-3/4th centuries) still preserved under the basilica, were selected to collect the bricks in order to define possible differences between the materials used for the various building phases. The walls are mainly shaped by yellow (with pale and dark hue) and beige colored bricks with an overall good conservation state. The ceramic bodies of this type of bricks showed the development of high-temperature phases but a low sintering degree was achieved. Moreover, secondary phases such as zeolites and calcite were formed, within almost the pale-yellow bodies and intensively precipitated through the groundmass of the beige bricks, respectively. Mg-rich calcareous clays and chloritic-illitic clays were used, firing temperatures of or over 900 degrees C were reached and more porous ceramic bodies were produced when higher was the carbonate content on the raw clays. A lesser carbonate content of the base clays and/or the decrease in the firing temperatures were the main technological modifications progressively accomplished, leading to color changes on the ceramic bodies from yellow to beige hue. The Roman production technologies might be largely inherited by the brick makers during the Late Antiquity and Medieval times in the city and the reuse of more ancient bricks during the Medieval Times was confirmed. Such reuse operations have allowed to observe that under high humid conditions the yellow hue bricks have been rather good preserved, while when exposed to insolation and fluctuations of the environmental conditions a significant granular disaggregation -with the concomitance darkening of the color pastes- is developed. The color of bricks may entail an identifier of a specific construction period of the city and durable bricks from local clays, especially suitable for high humidity areas and that may preserve the aesthetical values of the city of Padua, may be currently produced.

17	More than two million U.S. households have an eviction case filed against them each year. Policy makers at the federal, state, and local levels are increasingly pursuing policies to reduce the number of evictions, citing harm to tenants and high public expenditures related to homelessness. We study the consequences of eviction for tenants using newly linked administrative data from two major urban areas: Cook County (which includes Chicago) and New York City. We document that before housing court, tenants experience declines in earnings and employment and increases in financial distress and hospital visits. These pre trends pose a challenge for disentangling correlation and causation. To address this problem, we use an instrumental variables approach based on cases randomly assigned to judges of varying leniency. We find that an eviction order increases homelessness and hospital visits and reduces earnings, durable goods consumption, and access to credit in the first two years. Effects on housing and labor market outcomes are driven by effects for female and Black tenants. In the longer run, eviction increases indebtedness and reduces credit scores.
18	Thermochromic perovskite smart windows (TPWs) are a cutting-edge energy-efficient window technology. However, like most perovskite-based devices, humidity-related degradation limits their widespread application. Herein, inspired by the structure of medical masks, a unique triple-layer thermochromic perovskite window (MTPW) that enable sufficient water vapor transmission to trigger the thermochromism but effectively repel detrimental water and moisture to extend its lifespan is developed. The MTPW demonstrates superhydrophobicity and maintains a solar modulation ability above 20% during a 45-day aging test, with a decay rate 37 times lower than that of a pristine TPW. It can also immobilize lead ions and significantly reduce lead leakage by 66 times. Furthermore, a significant haze reduction from 90% to 30% is achieved, overcoming the blurriness problem of TPWs. Benefiting from the improved optical performance, extended lifespan, suppressed lead leakage, and facile fabrication, the MTPW pushes forward the wide applications of smart windows in green buildings. Thermochromic perovskite smart windows require humidity for operation, but too much can lead to degradation. Tso and coworkers demonstrate a mask-inspired system for humidity regulation, to extend lifespan and minimize optical haze.
19	As urban areas are increasingly exposed to high temperatures, lack of access to residential thermal comfort is a challenge with dramatic consequences for human health and well-being. Air-conditioning (AC) can provide relief against heat stress, but a massive AC uptake could entail stark energy demand growth and mitigation challenges. Slums pose additional risks due to poor building quality, failing to provide adequate shelter from severe climatic conditions. Thus, it is unclear how many people in the Global South will still lack access to basic cooling under different future climate and socioeconomic developments. We assess the impact of different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and climate futures on the extent of population lacking access to cooling where needed-the cooling gap-and energy requirements for basic comfort for a set of 22 megacities in the Global South. We find that different SSPs greatly influence the extent of future cooling gaps, generally larger in SSP3 due low income levels, and consequent limited access to AC and durable housing. Megacities in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have the largest share of population affected, ranging from 33% (SSP1) to 86% (SSP3) by mid-century. Energy requirements to provide basic cooling for all are higher in SSP1 for most megacities, driven by urbanization, and can increase by 7 to 23% moving from 2.0 to 3.0 degrees C temperature rise levels. Strategies combining improved building design and efficient cooling systems can improve adaptation to heat stress in cities while reducing energy and emission requirements to reach climate and sustainability goals.
20	This study focuses on the development of novel bio-composites using a silica matrix that provides dual functionality: as a hydrophobic surface treatment and as a binder for hemp-shiv. The hydrophilic nature of hemp shiv, a plant based aggregate, results in composites having poor interfacial adhesion, weak mechanical properties and long drying times. In this work, sol-gel process has been utilised to manufacture durable low density hemp based composites. Morphological characterisation by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that hemp shiv was embedded well in the matrix. Detailed chemical analysis using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicate the presence of water soluble and ethanol soluble extractives leached from the hemp shiv which are incorporated into the silica matrix inducing the binding effect. The composites were water resistant and showed good mechanical performance having the potential to develop novel thermal insulation building materials.
21	Mongolia government has proposed to build about 4,100km of paving road and 990km of highway connecting the capital city with all provincial centers between 2013 and 2016. Under the progress of road infrastructure development in Mongolia, early failures of asphalt pavement are occurred based on lack of selecting appropriate paving material and inadequate quality control during construction at extremely cold climate condition. The emerging technology of using polymer-modified asphalt and warm-mix asphalt are considered for building durable asphalt pavement in cold climate condition. Recently, polymer-modified asphalt technology and warm-mix asphalt technology are combined to use in asphalt pavement in Mongolia. The concept of polymer-modified combined warm-mix asphalt (PWMA) technology is to build the polymer-modified asphalt pavement at lower temperature than conventional polymer-modified asphalt mixture (CPMA). It is expected that PWMA pavement would improve crack resistance at low temperature with better compaction effect. This paper presents feasibility study results of the PWMA technology customized for cold climate condition such as Mongolia.
22	Clay brick waste is being generated in huge quantity every year due to increasing construction and demolition activities, causing serious waste is disposal problems. In traditional cement substitution or aggregate substitution methods, a limited amount of the clay brick waste can be reused in mortar or concrete to substitute part of cement or aggregate. This study attempted to reutilize clay brick dust (CBD) based on paste substitution method (by substituting a portion of the paste by an equal volume of CBD without changing the paste composition and water/cementitious materials ratio) to produce mortar, and conducted tests to study its workability in terms of flow spread, and durability in terms of sulphate resistance, water resistance and shrinkage resistance. The findings revealed that reutilizing CBD as paste substitution would increase the superplasticizer demand, but could substantially enhance the sulphate, water and shrinkage resistances, and reduce the cement content and associated carbon footprint. It was shown that up to 20% CBD by volume of the mortar may be added to reduce the cement content by 33% without causing adverse effects. Such percentage reduction in cement content is larger than possible with cement or aggregate substitution. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
23	In the current implementation of EPC-s, the assessment focus is purely on the energy consumption data. For the next generation of EPC-s, new performance indicators are proposed to address relevant building performance aspects, such as sustainability, productivity and market value. These indicators would enable evidence-based decision-making processes and facilitate the delivery of renovation triggers. Within the EPC framework, the problem is not the availability of such performance indicators, but the assessment effort required. Only easily available data can justifiably be introduced to bulk EPC-s, either as direct complementary input or as a performance indicator. Availability of such data was analysed from case studies that included EPC-s from 11 EU member states, mainly non-residential buildings. Analysed data included relevant HVAC information such as ventilation air flows, heating and cooling set-points and installed power, but also output data, such as EPC classes, net and primary energy need and GHG emissions. Based on our findings, we outlined two different development paths - one for existing buildings and one for new buildings and major renovations. Two categories of complementary indicators to energy are proposed - IEQ and power indicators.
24	Policy PointsMore rigorous methodologies and systematic approaches should be encouraged in the science of scaling. This will help researchers better determine the effectiveness of scaling, guide stakeholders in the scaling process, and ultimately increase the impacts of health innovations.The practice and the science of scaling need to expand worldwide to address complex health conditions such as noncommunicable and chronic diseases. Although most of the scaling experiences described in the literature are occurring in the Global South, most of the authors publishing on it are based in the Global North. As the science of scaling spreads across the world with the aim of reducing health inequities, it is also essential to address the power imbalance in how we do scaling research globally. ContextScaling of effective innovations in health and social care is essential to increase their impact. We aimed to synthesize the evidence base on scaling and identify current knowledge gaps. MethodsWe conducted an umbrella review according to the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers' Manual. We included any type of review that 1) focused on scaling, 2) covered health or social care, and 3) presented a methods section. We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest), Academic Search Premier (EBSCO), and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global from their inception to August 6, 2020. We searched the gray literature using, e.g., Google and WHO-ExpandNet. We assessed methodological quality with AMSTAR2. Paired reviewers independently selected and extracted eligible reviews and assessed study quality. A narrative synthesis was performed. FindingsOf 24,269 records, 137 unique reviews were included. The quality of the 58 systematic reviews was critically low (n = 42). The most frequent review type was systematic review (n = 58). Most reported on scaling in low- and middle-income countries (n = 59), whereas most first authors were from high-income countries (n = 114). Most reviews concerned infectious diseases (n = 36) or maternal-child health (n = 28). They mainly focused on interventions (n = 37), barriers and facilitators (n = 29), frameworks (n = 24), scalability (n = 24), and costs (n = 14). The WHO/ExpandNet scaling definition was the definition most frequently used (n = 26). Domains most reported as influencing scaling success were building scaling infrastructure (e.g., creating new service sites) and human resources (e.g., training community health care providers). ConclusionsThe evidence base on scaling is evolving rapidly as reflected by publication trends, the range of focus areas, and diversity of scaling definitions. Our study highlights knowledge gaps around methodology and research infrastructures to facilitate equitable North-South research relationships. Common efforts are needed to ensure scaling expands the impacts of health and social innovations to broader populations.
25	A city's in-use stock comprises the built environment and manufactured products, which shape a city's weight and play vital roles in human activities. However, researchers have not accurately quantified urban weight and its composition, or how stock types change during urbanization. We quantified Beijing's in-use stock from 1978 to 2015 by bottom-up material-flow analysis for building, infrastructure, and manufactured product stocks, with 11 sub-types (e.g., roads), and 54 accounting items (e.g., expressways). We discuss the driving factors for changes in these stocks and their composition. Beijing's in-use stock increased from 224 Mt in 1978 to 1925 Mt in 2015, an increase of nearly 9 times (19 times the global stock per unit area). This resulted primarily from increases in stocks that accounted for >20% of the total: urban residential buildings (30%), non-residential buildings (26%), and roads (20%), which grew to 15, 5, and 11 times the 1978 levels, respectively. However, the growth rate of these stocks slowed by the end of the study period. Manufactured products represented <4% of the stock, but grew fastest (increasing to 41 times the 1978 value), especially for durable consumer goods and vehicles. This category cannot be neglected because of the increasing purchasing power of residents. The trends for the stock weights remained strongly coupled with population factors, whereas the stocks showed relative decoupling from economic factors (e.g., GDP, investment). These results will help policymakers diagnose problems with Beijing's urban development, thereby improving estimates of future resource demand and providing insights into strategies to slow the increase in urban weight.

26	This paper reports on the performance of using a multistage constructed wetland (CW) to treat municipal raw wastewater and an analysis of its suitability for agricultural irrigation. The pilot plant consists of two stages of vertical flow CWs plus one stage of a horizontal CW built in 2018 with different local materials at the Gaston Berger University Campus, Saint Louis (Senegal). Each CW stage is composed of several filters with different type of media (silex, granite, or river gravel), filtering media depths, and macrophytes (Phragmites and Typha). The physicochemical and microbiological indicators were monitored over six months at each bed inlet and outlet to evaluate the efficiency and achievements of the Senegalese, European, and WHO regulations/recommendations for disposal or reuse in irrigation. This study demonstrates the viability of this new multistage CW design to treat raw municipal wastewater and produce an effluent of good quality suitable for reuse in agriculture. The removal of organic matter, suspended solids, and nutrients was very high (>95% for SS, BOD5 and N-NH4+, >90% for COD and P-PO43-), as was the reduction of microbiological indicators (fecal coliform reduction >5 log units and helminth egg removal of 100%). First, trends related to the influence of design (the type of gravel, filter depth, and type of macrophyte), operational modes, and the CW treatment efficiency were determined. The use of non-crushed gravel and Typha spp. seemed to provide better removal rates. On the contrary, no differences were found between the use of silex or granite gravel. For the studied Senegalese conditions under dry and hot climates, the preliminary results indicate that no resting periods are necessary for vertical flow CWs (VFCWs), thus resulting in a reduction in construction and operation costs. The main outcome of our study is evidence that multistage CWs can provide robust, cost-effective treatments, as well as allow for safe water reuse, which is imperative in areas with severe water scarcity and endemic microbiological waterborne diseases.
27	Micro-forest projects are multiplying throughout cities as a new emblem of ecological design of artificial environments. This emerging form of renaturation is bringing a new public narrative investing the discourse of nature based-solutions and civic participation. In Paris, the first micro -forest proposal was carried and implemented by a civic group with the technical and financial support of the municipality. This article analyzes the governance of this nature-based solution through its coproduction, identifying its achievement and challenges on several pilot sites. The analysis shows how a new public narrative is being built from a civic experimentation, while obscuring the difficulties encountered locally by an initiative that faces the territorial complexity of a highly degraded urban environment.
28	Cities generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions both in the construction phase of their built environment stocks and durable goods and in their operation phase with energy and material flows. Existing urban GHG accounting methods, however, focus largely on emissions related to energy and material flows and have rarely considered the role of urban stocks. In this article, we have extended urban stocks and flows analysis to urban GHG accounting, using bottom-up and high-resolution urban stocks and flows information for a case of Odense, Denmark. We introduced a complementary indicator of carbon replacement value (CRV) to account for emissions embodied in the urban stocks and determined the CRV of Odense as 10.7 megatons of CO2 equivalent (or 53 metric tons per capita) in 2017, equivalent to 13 years of Odense's operational emissions. The comparison between CRV and operational emissions across urban activities facilitates a better understanding of the carbon profile of the city and opportunities for decarbonization. Such urban metabolic based GHG accounting and inclusion of stocks can help to estimate the amount of GHG emissions to be expected from the further urbanization in developing countries as their urban stocks continue to increase and inform their potentials for leapfrogging in emission reduction.
29	The LPSA (Light Post-tensioned Segmented Arch) technology transforms small diameter timber (SDT) into a formidable competitor for structural steel in construction. The jointing problem and its analysis "black box" in timber engineering are decisively resolved and the need for joint strength testing is eliminated. A slide-fit socketing mechanism, via reusable prefabricated connectors, is combined with tension-induced compression adhesion. Manufacture, transportation and assembly of structures are reduced to dealing with portable modular components. Substantial savings in cost, energy, time, skills and equipment are achieved. Resulting LPSA bridge and building structures are quantifiable, reusable and potentially earthquake-durable. A "sustainable engineering science" framework based on SDT is proposed to bridge the gap with mainstream advances in continuum and computational mechanics. SDT mass utilization could save what is left of the world's forests.
30	Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising for large-scale energy storage because of the low cost and earth abundance of sodium. Although tin monosulfide (SnS) has attracted broad interest in SIBs due to its layered structure and large capacity, the sluggish sodiation kinetics, substantial volumetric variation, and electrochemical dissolution of intermediate polysulfides during cycling hinder its practical implementation. Herein, we report a spatially confined synthesis of superlattice-like SnS/N-doped graphene (NG) hybrids composed of alternately stacked SnS and NG nanosheets as high-rate and long-life anode materials for SIBs. The density functional theory calculations reveal the enhanced densities of states (DOSs) near the Fermi level and increased interfacial conductivity for the SnS/NG heterostructured nanobelts. In SnS/NG hybrids, the SnS is sandwiched between the NG layers enabling enlarged SnS interlayer spacing and a strong built-in field between adjacent SnS and NG, which facilitates the Na-ion diffusion and sodiation/desodiation reactions with rapid kinetics. Moreover, the conductive NG layers not only improve the conductivity in the composite but also provide the 2D confined interspace to accommodate the volume variation of SnS and mitigate polysulfide effusion and shuttling during cycling to yield excellent cycling stability. Consequently, the superlattice-like SnS/NG hybrid shows a large capacity of 600 mA h g(-1) at 1600 mA g(-1), a high rate capability of 550 mA h g(-1) at 14 580 mA g(-1) and an excellent cycling stability with 0.004% decay per cycle for over 1200 cycles, outperforming the reported sulfides so far. The full cell with the SnS/NG anode and Na3V2(PO4)(3) cathode has a large energy density of 160 W h kg(-1) and good cycling stability, demonstrating promising applications in electrochemical energy storage.
31	Dynamic windows, which switch between transparent and opaque states as the temperature changes, can be applied in buildings to reduce building energy consumption. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) is the most studied thermochromic hydrogel for climate-resilient smart window applications. In addition to its poor mechanical properties and low reaction rate, the PNIPAm hydrogel must be sandwiched between two pieces of glass to form an interlayer in practical applications. Here, durable PU-PNIPAmn copolymers for smart windows were synthesized by reacting the synthesized poly-NIPAm diols with isocyanate (-NCO) monomer, which greatly improved the mechanical properties of the hydrogel and it was able to form a film alone. These temperature-sensitive films can switch between transparent (>80% transmittance) and opaque (<5% transmittance) states in less than 10 minutes, with no degradation in optical contrast, switching speed, or uniformity after at least 100 switching cycles.
32	Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is a life-threatening, immunologically mediated, and usually drug-induced disease with a high burden to individuals, their families, and society with an annual incidence of 1 to 5 per 1,000,000. To effect significant reduction in short-and long-term morbidity and mortality, and advance clinical care and research, coordination of multiple medical, surgical, behavioral, and basic scientific disciplines is required. On March 2, 2017, an investigator-driven meeting was held immediately before the American Academy of Dermatology Annual meeting for the central purpose of assembling, for the first time in the United States, clinicians and scientists from multiple disciplines involved in SJS/TEN clinical care and basic science research. As a product of this meeting, this article summarizes the current state of knowledge and expert opinion related to SJS/TEN covering a broad spectrum of topics including epidemiology and pharmacogenomic networks; clinical management and complications; special populations such as pediatrics, the elderly, and pregnant women; regulatory issues and the electronic health record; new agents that cause SJS/TEN; pharmacogenomics and immunopathogenesis; and the patient perspective. Goals include the maintenance of a durable and productive multidisciplinary network that will significantly further scientific progress and translation into prevention, early diagnosis, and management of SJS/TEN.

33	The manipulation of stress in high-capacity microscale alloying anode materials, which undergo significant volumetric variation during cycling, is crucial prerequisite for improved their cycling capability. In this work, an innovative structural design strategy is proposed for scalable fabrication of a unique 3D highly porous micro structured germanium (Ge) featuring micro-nano hierarchical architecture as viable anode for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The resultant micro-sized Ge, consisting of interconnected nanoligaments and bicontinuous nanopores, is endowed with high activity, decreased Li+ diffusion distance and alleviated volume variation, appealing as an ideal platform for in-depth understanding the relationship between structural design and stress evolution. Such a micro-sized Ge being highly porous delivers a record high initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.5%, large volumetric capacity of 2,421 mAh cm(-3) at 1.2 mA cm(-2), exceptional rate capability (805.6 mAh g(-1) at 10 Ag-1) and cycling stability (over 90% capacity retention after 1000 cycles even at 5 A g(-1)), largely outperforming the reported Ge-based anodes for LIBs. Furthermore, its underlying Li storage mechanism and stress dispersion behavior are explicitly revealed by combined substantial in situ/ex situ experimental characterizations and theoretical computation. This work provides novel insights into the rational design of high-performance and durable alloying anodes toward high-energy LIBs.
34	Innovative cement-based premix products for surface coating of buildings that possess photocatalytic activity arouse great interest because of the results they can achieve in reducting air pollution and maintaining aesthetics. This photoactivity is induced by a photocatalyst, titanium dioxide, that can accelerate the oxidation processes of air pollutants, particularly nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, which are mainly produced by incomplete combustion of fuel and are present in urban environments through the exhaust gases of motor vehicles. Surfaces that are coated with these products acquire a self-cleaning characteristic (maintenance of original color) because the decomposition of organic compounds significantly reduces the ability of atmospheric particles to adhere to treated surfaces, thus facilitating their removal and ensuring a more durable color. These products are particularly suited for use in highly congested areas (i.e., historical centers of cities, tunnels, roads), where air pollution reaches significant levels. This study describes the photocatalytic performances of a series of premix products containing mineral pigments. The tested products are based on hydraulic binders (natural hydraulic lime and cement), and the pigments are inorganic. A wide range of colors was chosen, and the performances of base products were investigated to provide a wider choice to the designers. After a brief introduction of the principles of photocatalysis, the results of a wide experimental work are described. Some consideration of methods of curing and natural exposure is also reported.
35	The optimization of charge transport with electron-hole separation directed toward specific redox reactions is a crucial mission for artificial photosynthesis. Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4, BVO) is a popular photoanode material for solar water splitting, but it faces tricky challenges in poor charge separation due to its modest charge transport properties. Here, a concept of the external electron transport layer (ETL) is first proposed and demonstrated its effectiveness in suppressing the charge recombination both in bulk and at surface. Specifically, a conformal carbon capsulation applied on BVO enables a remarkable increase in the charge separation efficiency, thanks to its critical roles in passivating surface charge-trapping sites and building external conductance channels. Through decorated with an oxygen evolution catalyst to accelerate surface charge transfer, the carbon-encased BVO (BVO@C) photoanode manifests durable water splitting over 120 h with a high current density of 5.9 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under 1 sun irradiation (100 mW cm(-2), AM 1.5 G), which is an activity-stability trade-off record for single BVO light absorber. This work opens up a new avenue to steer charge separation via external ETL for solar fuel conversion.
36	How might we begin to explore the concept of the "sustainable city" in a world often characterized as dynamic, fluid, and contested? Debates about the sustainable city are too often dominated by a technological discourse conducted among professional experts, but this technocratic framing is open to challenge. For some critics, sustainability is a meaningless notion, yet for others its semantic pliability opens up discursive spaces through which to explore interconnections across time, space, and scale. Thus, while enacting sustainability in policy and practice is an arduous task, we can productively ask how cultural imaginations might be stirred and shaken to make sustainability accessible to a wider public who might join the conversation. What role, we ask, can and should the arts play in wider debates about sustainability in the city today? We explore a coproduced artwork in the northeast of England in order to explain how practice-led research methods were put into dialogue with the social sciences to activate new perspectives on the politics, aesthetics, and practices of sustainability. The case is presented to argue that creative material experimentations can be used as an active research inquiry through which ideas can be tested without knowing predefined means or ends. The case shows how such creativity acts as a catalyst to engage a heterogeneous mix of actors in the redefinition of urban spaces, juxtaposing past and present, with the ephemeral and the (seemingly) durable.
37	Vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) are regarded as the most promising high-performance thermal insulation products on the market today. A high and stable vacuum state within VIP enclosure provides a durable service life for VIP. In this paper, multiple core material layers (CMLs) with thickness of 0.5 mm, 1 mm, 3 mm, and 7 mm were formed as the core of glassfiber VIPs. The microstructure of the core materials and thermal conductivity of as-prepared VIPs was investigated. The porosity of the core materials was about 90% while the mean pore diameter was about 10 similar to 25 mu m. At adopted pressure holding time of extraction process of 1805, the initial total thermal conductivity of VIPs was lower than 4 mW/(m K) and slightly increased with total thickness of core material, but increased greatly with CMLs thickness. Mass transfer characteristics within core material during extraction process was analyzed based on the interlayer-microstructure model. Residual gases within VIPs were mainly extracted from the connected gas flow channel built by glass fibers. The optimum pressure holding time for VIPs with 0.5 mm-thickness, 1 mm-thickness, 3 mm-thickness, and 7 mm-thickness CMLs was 300s, 240s, 240s, and 180s, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

38	Carbon-based aerogels (CA) with durable piezoresistive properties possess great promise for applications in wearable electronics. However, it is still a great challenge to fabricate high performance aerogel sensors due to the limits of mechanical properties. We recently developed a novel strategy to build aerogel/foam hybrid structure that can effectively enhance the mechanical properties of aerogel-based sensors. Herein, CA/ polyurethane foam (PUF) composite was fabricated via in situ unidirectional freeze-drying process starting from a carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/graphene oxide (GO) aqueous dispersion stabilized with chitosan (CS) which was filled into the porosity of an open cell PUF. The resulting composite shows a microscopic ani-sotropy in the CA with electrical conductivity as high as 10.54 S m(-1). The piezoresistive sensitivity of the resulting composite can be simply modulated over a wide range from 1.1 to 3.6 by adequately selecting its initial pre-strain. The CA/PUF composite exhibits excellent compressible resilience at the strain of 50% for at least 100 cycles. In addition, the sensor was successfully applied for detecting various human motions. These unique properties make the realized composite a promising candidate for effective flexible piezo-resistive strain sensors in wearable applications.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
39	Robust underwater oil-repellent materials combining high mechanical strength and durability with superwettability and low oil adhesion are needed to build oil-repellent devices able to work in water, to manipulate droplet behavior, etc. However, combining all of these properties within a single, durable material remains a challenge. Herein, we fabricate a robust underwater oil-resistant material (Al2O3) with all of the above properties by gel casting. The micro/nanoceramic particles distributed on the surface endow the material with excellent underwater superoleophobicity (similar to 160 degrees) and low oil adhesion (<4 mu N). In addition, the substrate exhibits typical ceramic characteristics such as good antiacid/alkali properties, high salt resistance, and high load tolerance. These excellent properties make the material not only applicable to various liquid environments but also resistant to the impact of particles and other physical damage. More importantly, the substrate could still exhibit underwater superoleophobicity after being worn under specific conditions, as wear will create new surfaces with similar particle size distribution. This approach is easily scalable for mass production, which could open a pathway for the fabrication of practical underwater long-lasting functional interfacial materials.
40	The evaluation of asphalt mixture fatigue performance holds increasing significance in the context of asphalt concrete pavement and various polymer modifiers. This study focuses on assessing the fatigue and reflection crack performance of two asphalt types: a conventional 10 mm SMA mixture with a fixed PG grade (PG 76-22) and a modified asphalt employing SBS, available in multiple grades (ranging from PG 76-22 to PG 82-22). Additionally, this study in-corporates crumb rubber powder (CRP-6%) and epoxy resin (ER-4%) into the conventional SBS-modified SMA binder, reducing conventional asphalt binder consumption and promoting the utilization of recycled waste materials. To achieve this goal, comprehensive evaluations of fatigue cracking performance were conducted on SMA mixtures through multiple stressed creep and recovery tests, Texas overlay tests, and direct tensile cyclic fatigue tests. The results reveal that the modified binder exhibited superior strain recovery and a reduced strain rate in comparison to the reference binder under creep loads at MSCR levels of 0.1 and 3.2 KPa. The findings also indicate a 19.5% load reduction in the modified asphalt mixture with PG 72-22 binders, epoxy, and CRP after 1000 cycles, compared to 39.8% for the conventional mixture with a PG 76-22 binder. Moreover, the modified mixture demonstrated significant improvements, with 3.7 times more repetitions and 3.9 times more interactions to failure at strain levels of 330 and 360, respectively. Importantly, the research highlights the superior fatigue crack resistance performance of the PG 76-28 grade mixture compared to PG 76-22, positioning it as an optimal choice for aged concrete overlay applications. In conclusion, this study contributes to the development of more durable and reliable polymer-modified SMA mixtures enhanced with epoxy and crumb rubber, facilitating the advancement of sustainable road infrastructure.
41	Solar radiation can be used to activate photocatalyst for direct functional photocatalytic applications. In the present research, solar photocatalytic asphalt was developed for removal of vehicular nitrogen oxides (NOx) to mitigate the roadside air pollution problem. Visible-light activated photocatalytic asphalt was fabricated by embedding carbon-modified titanium dioxide (C-TiO2) onto asphalt surface under proper heat treatment. Material characterizations were conducted to study the surface and light absorption properties. Chamber tests of NOx removal were conducted under the conditions that simulated the ambient environment under sunlight. The experimental results show that NOx, removal by C-TiO2 photocatalytic asphalt is viable, and is better than the more commonly used P25. The parametric analysis also reveals that the material fabrication process can be optimized to make photocatalytic asphalt that is highly effective, durable and cost-effective. Field tests were carried out to reveal the feasibility and evaluate the durability of the photocatalytic coating. This study demonstrates successful use of solar radiation via photocatalysis for functional application that can solve environmental problems.
42	The current COVID-19 vaccination program requires frequent booster vaccination to maintain sufficient neutralization levels against immune evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, prior studies found more potent and durable immune response in convalescing individuals, raising the possibility of less frequent booster vaccination for them. Here, we conducted a longitudinal immunological study based on two prospective cohorts of booster vaccinated convalescing COVID-19 patients or healthcare workers (HCW) without COVID-19 history in Xiangyang, China. Comparing to 1-month post-boosting, pseudovirus neutralization titers (pVNT50) of ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 and circulating omicron sub-variants BA.5, BF.7, BA.4.6, BA.2.75, and BA.2.75.2 spikes were stable or even increased in convalescing samples at 6-month post-boosting, when HCW samples showed substantial drop of neutralization titers across the spectrum. Variant-to-Wuhan-Hu-1 pVNT50 ratios showed no significant variation during the 17 months from pre-vaccination to 6-month post-boosting in convalescing individuals, indicating that the high durability of hybrid immunity was likely sustained by continuously improving neutralization potency that compensated immune decay. Our data provide mechanistic insight into prior epidemiological findings that vaccine-elicited humoral immune response was more durable in convalescing individuals than those without SARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggest further research into potential extension of boosting intervals for convalescing individuals.
43	This paper presents a review of harvesting green energy from road23. There are three forms of green energy exist in road: light, thermal and mechanical energy. Photovoltaic technology, thermoelectric technology, directly heat transferring and piezoelectric technology are discussed in this paper, as well as the cases studied in Europe, USA, Japan, Israel and China. Solar panels installed along road are current available to harvest light energy from the roadside land. Alternatively, the solar panels can be installed on the road instead of pavement structures, such as the Solar Roadway (TM). This technology is rather conceptual at this moment, and the main challenge is to design and build durable materials and structures that can withstand traffic at a reasonable maintenance and replacement cost. Thermoelectric generators can potentially be embedded in pavements, and generate electric power from the temperature gradient existing in pavements. However, instrument capable of efficiently generate electricity from the relatively small temperature gradient in pavement is still under development. Directly heat transfer solution is to have fluid flow through pavement, and the fluid is heated (in summer) by the pavement. An extra benefit in addition to energy collection is that this method can reduce pavement temperature as well as the associated negative effects on pavement performance and the environment. However how the heated fluid can be utilized was not clear. Electricity can be generated by piezoelectric ceramic generators embedded in pavement, as a result of the compressive stress and deformation induced by moving vehicles. Trials have been reported in Israel and China, and it was estimated that one lane-mile of highway can potentially general electricity of 200 kW.
44	Most self-proclaimed sustainable neighborhoods cover various concepts pertaining to the economic, social, environmental, and institutional pillars of sustainability. Depending on the developers' motivations, these concepts can be integrated unevenly. This study develops a framework to characterise the gap between what is advocated as necessary for sustainable neighborhoods and what is marketed as sustainable neighborhoods. A framework based on a sustainable neighborhood typology is developed using the Canadian province of Quebec as a case study. This is based on the main concepts underlying the four pillars of sustainability, but from a practical perspective. An analysis of sustainable initiatives (n = 29) shows a clear prioritisation of urban morphology on individual livability at the expense of participatory governance and sustainability awareness, especially for large projects promoted by private developers. A co-occurrence analysis suggests that smaller projects manage to integrate more sustainability aspects. The framework can be used to identify similarities and differences between development types for developing practical policy measures. This research highlights the importance involving public and private stakeholders at the early planning stage, in order to design more integrated projects. Policy relevance A gap is revealed between what is defined as urban sustainability and what is actually delivered by developers. Citizen participation is generally beneficial, but often lacking. There is scope for policymakers to provide compelling encouragement to build citizen involvement into the planning processes, particularly for larger neighborhood developments. From the example of the province of Quebec, this can take several forms. In some cases, more incentives from the public sector to involve citizens at the early stage of planning is favorable. This can allow stakeholders to outline the development strategy in neighborhoods. In other cases, municipalities can involve residents through a charter or regular local meetings. This requires more systemic municipal approaches to urban sustainability. Evidence suggests that local relocation of food and/or energy production can lead to successful cases of citizen participation and social solidarity.
45	A mid-century net zero target creates a challenge for reducing the emissions of emissions-intensive, trade-exposed sectors with high cost mitigation options. These sectors include aluminium, cement, chemicals, iron and steel, lime, pulp and paper and petroleum refining. Available studies agree that decarbonization of these sectors is possible by mid-century if more ambitious policies are implemented soon. Existing carbon pricing policies have had limited impact on the emissions of these sectors because their marginal abatement costs almost always exceed the tax rate or allowance price. But emissions trading systems with free allowance allocations to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed sectors have minimized the adverse economic impacts and associated leakage. Internationally coordinated policies are unlikely, so implementing more ambitious policies creates a risk of leakage. This paper presents policy packages a country can implement to accelerate emission reduction by these sectors with minimal risk of leakage. To comply with international trade law the policy packages differ for producers whose goods compete with imports in the domestic market and producers whose goods are exported. Carbon pricing is a critical component of each package due its ability to minimize the risk of adverse economic impacts on domestic industry, support innovation and generate revenue. The revenue can be used to assist groups adversely impacted by the domestic price and production changes due to carbon pricing and to build public support for the policies.
46	There is wide agreement on the benefits of integrated care; yet funding barriers persist. We suggest that funding models could currently hinder quality of care and that identifying values is necessary to designing adequate funding models. Yet it is currently unclear what are these values that ought to shape healthcare policy decisions. To fill in this gap, we conducted semi-structure interviews with fourteen health policy officials, managers, and researchers to elicit and explore how they conceptualize the values and guiding principles underlying these funding policies. Our findings suggest that values guide population-based integrated funding models, namely: accountability & integrity, transparency, equity, and innovation. Overall, funding mechanisms could incentivize integrated population-based care when the following conditions are met: a) there is transparent governance, with a whole-system approach, political will, and engagement and collaboration across health system partners, organizations and institutions, b) regulatory and evaluative frameworks support accountability including in decision-making, in outcomes and quality of care, as well as financial accountability; c) funding is equitable with a fair distribution of resources and supports accessibility to services; and d) funding mechanisms design and implementation include innovation enabling change, which are continuously evaluated. These values and guiding principles could be used in the development of funding models and future studies need to evaluate the effect of these values on decisions made by policy makers with respect to funding allocations and investments.
47	The use of plastics is common across all aspects of human life owing to its durable and versatile nature. The gen-eration and utilization of plastics are directly related to the anthropogenic activities. The extensive use of plastics and adoption of inappropriate waste-management frameworks has resulted in their release into the environ-ment, where they may persist. Different environmental factors, such as, photochemical, thermo-oxidation, and biological degradation, can lead to the degradation of plastics into micro-(MPs) and nano-plastics (NPs). The be-haviour and concentration of MPs in the terrestrial environment can depend on their size, density, and local at-mospheric conditions. Microplastics and nanoplastics may enter the food web, carrying various organic pollutants, which bio-accumulate at different trophic levels, prompting organism health concerns. Microplastics being airborne identifies as new exposure route. Dietary and airborne exposure to MPs has led researchers to stress the importance of evaluating their toxicological potential. The primary goal of this paper is to explore the environmental fate of MPs from sources to sink in the terrestrial environment, as well as detail their potential impacts on human health. Additionally, this review article focuses on the presence of airborne microplastics, de-tailed sample pre-processing methods, and outlines analytical methods for their characterization .

48	Metal telluride (MTe)-based nanomaterials have emerged as a potential alternative for efficient, highly conductive, robust, and durable electrodes in energy storage/conversion applications. Significant progress in the material development of MTe-based electrodes is well-sought, from the synthesis of its nanostructures, integration of MTes with supporting materials, synthesis of their hybrid morphologies, and their implications in energy storage/conversion systems. Herein, an extensive exploration of the recent advancements and progress in MTes-based nanomaterials is reviewed. This review emphasizes elucidating the fundamental properties of MTes and providing a systematic compilation of its wet and dry synthesis methods. The applications of MTes are extensively summarized and discussed, particularly, in energy storage and conversion systems including batteries (Li-ion, Zn-ion, Li-S, Na-ion, K-ion), supercapacitor, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and CO2 reduction. The review also emphasizes the future prospects and urgent challenges to be addressed in the development of MTes, providing knowledge for researchers in utilizing MTes in energy storage and conversion technologies. This review highlights the recent advancements in metal telluride synthesis routes, emphasizing their distinctive advantages in energy storage conversion systems. Further, it addresses future challenges, potential research directions, and the promising opportunities presented by metal telluride. image
49	Amplification of and oncogenic mutations in ERBB2, the gene encoding the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase, promote receptor hyperactivation and tumor growth. Here we demonstrate that HER2 ubiquitination and internalization, rather than its overexpression, are key mechanisms underlying endocytosis and consequent efficacy of the anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in lung cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. These data translated into a 51% response rate in a clinical trial of T-DM1 in 49 patients with ERBB2-amplified or -mutant lung cancers. We show that cotreatment with irreversible pan-HER inhibitors enhances receptor ubiquitination and consequent ADC internalization and efficacy. We also demonstrate that ADC switching to T-DXd, which harbors a different cytotoxic payload, achieves durable responses in a patient with lung cancer and corresponding xenograft model developing resistance to T-DM1. Our findings may help guide future clinical trials and expand the field of ADC as cancer therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: T-DM1 is clinically effective in lung cancers with amplification of or mutations in ERBB2. This activity is enhanced by cotreatment with irreversible pan-HER inhibitors, or ADC switching to T-DXd. These results may help address unmet needs of patients with HER2-activated tumors and no approved targeted therapy.
50	We report the results of a project aimed to introduce proton exchange membrane (PEM) hydrogen fuel cell technology into aviation ground support equipment (GSE) and rental construction equipment. The purpose of the project was to design, build, field-test and then commercialize fuel cell equipment that is superior to its diesel counterpart. The commercializing of this hydrogen-based technology will help to start the process of displacing diesel fuel use in aviation GSE and in mobile construction equipment. We describe a hydrogen fuel cell mobile lighting tower (H2LT) that combines hydrogen stored as a high pressure gas, PEM fuel cell technology, and advanced lighting into a single unit with uses in aviation and construction. We assembled a project team of 15 institutional partners combining new technology expertise (hydrogen, fuel cells), equipment mass manufacturing capability (mobile light towers, lighting) and influential end-users to field test the H2LT in real-world use in diverse environments. Seed funding provided by Boeing enabled additional funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and a preponderance of in-kind contributions from the industrial partners. Prototype units were constructed and field tested in the entertainment industry, at the San Francisco International Airport, at the NASA Kennedy Space Center, with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and with the Connecticut Department of Transportation. The goals of these approximately year-long field tests were to assess operation of the H2LT technology in a wide variety of potentially corrosive environments (cold, wet, hot, humid, salty air) performing a wide variety of tasks, to reduce diesel emissions at these locations, and to help promote hydrogen PEM technology in new influential markets. The H2LT proved to be exceptionally durable in these diverse environments, demonstrating the compatibility of PEM fuel cells and high-pressure hydrogen storage with the construction equipment application. Results from the field tests are discussed, including system performance (efficiency, duration, durability) and the efficacy of refueling the system by different methods (H-2 stations, mobile refueling). The H2LT system is compared directly to a comparable diesel-fueled light tower with regard to size, performance and emissions savings. Overall, end users were pleased with the performance of the H2LT, noting the lack of emissions and exceptionally low noise level. Recommendations for improvement were also collected and will be discussed. Two types of lighting used on the H2LT (plasma, LED) were characterized by U.C. Davis in collaboration with Caltrans. LED lighting was found to be the most energy efficient and robust lighting technology for the highly mobile H2LT application. The technical "lessons-learned" are reviewed, along with the plans for commercialization of the H2LT technology by Multiquip Inc. Finally, the benefits to the industrial participants of the project organization are described. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
51	When the sick, injured, or dying arrive in a hospital - often along with family members - they find themselves on an alien landscape. Elderly people enter unfamiliar territory as they move from home or hospital into a long-term care setting, which may be the first in a series of placements for their final years. African Americans have been subjected for decades to oppressive urban planning policies, including 'serial displacement', which have systematically uprooted and dispersed them, their homes, and their places of business and worship. Around the world currently, 65 million people are displaced, most trying to escape uninhabitable environs involving war, persecution, drought, and famine. Some of these migrants and asylum-seekers reside in and around refugee camps but many are in urban enclaves or isolated outside them in desperately inhospitable conditions. Some are trying to integrate and make homes in new countries. Still more people are coming in perilous flight from the unfurling effects of climate change. 'We are place-lings,' according to Ed Casey, 'never without emplaced experiences'. Lorraine Code, explaining our social and geographical embeddedness and interdependence, describes us as 'ecological subjects'. By recognizing place, we can deepen our appreciation for the ways in which we are radically relational, that is, interdependent with people, non-human others, and particular locations. This robust and realistic conception of our relational nature and its implications for health and ethics deserves more attention. Elsewhere I have argued for 'ethical place-making' as morally obligatory for supporting the capability to be healthy, or health justice, for ecological subjects. Drawing on this conception of persons as creatures situated in specific social relations, geographic locations, and atmospheric and material environments, here I emphasize the importance of place and argue for an ideal and practice of 'ethical place-making' as an essential and, indeed, ethically required way of demonstrating and forging future solidarity and advancing justice, particularly health justice. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I explain what I mean by place and examine the relationships, revealed by contemporary research in social epidemiology, between place and health. In Section 3, I build on the conception of persons as ecological subjects to ground what Carol Gould has called 'solidaristic recognition', which, as I will interpret it, requires us to reckon with the significance of place in our relational nature. I then link solidaristic recognition to the ideal and practice of ethical place-making and, in turn, the capability to be healthy, that is, health justice. I argue that place-based interventions should be principal and prioritized ways of showing solidarity and promoting justice - especially health justice - for ecological subjects, above all those who are displaced and/or insecurely placed. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, ethical place-making has the potential to catalyze and nurture them and, over time, to advance justice. A full discussion of the complex and contested relationship between solidarity and global justice is beyond the scope of what I can expound on here; I follow - and present concrete manifestations of - the views of Iris Marion Young and Carol Gould in seeing solidarity as having, as Gould puts it, a crucial 'role not only in motivating people's commitment to the realization of global justice but [also] contribut[ing] to its construction or constitution.' In Section 4, I present examples of ethical place-making inspired by solidaristic recognition in a range of domains significant for bioethics - clinical and long-term care and urban planning in the United States and Netherlands, and refugee care and resettlement in Lebanon and Germany. In the cases presented, I describe how the particular elements of ethical place-making, emerging from solidaristic recognition, are realized, and so support the conditions for the capability to healthy, or health justice. Following this discussion, I move on to the conclusion. Place 'is no fixed thing'. The accounts of geographers, philosophers, and some architects emphasize our embodied experience in or around place(s), place's significance for the development of our subjectivity and identity, and, finally, the complex social processes that help to create, maintain, and transform places (and, in turn, bodies and subjectivities). The understanding I follow here defines 'place' in terms of the material environment, and how we, as embodied beings, move in, absorb, shape and are shaped by it, and how we, as social agents, interact with and within it, gather and attach particular meanings, and forge relationships and identities. A growing body of research in social epidemiology using realist methods explains in increasingly rich, if grim, detail the ways in which social conditions and features of the external environment, including place-related factors, affect health and longevity, and contribute to preventable health inequities. We are talking about components of the built environment, like land use, housing design, materials and quality, street layout and transportation, exposure to toxins, and violence, access to food and activity options; and urban design or decline. Air and water quality, and access to green space are other place-related factors. We should also include climate and the potential in specific locations for climate-related disasters in our scope of concern. So-called 'determinants' such as these operate independently and interactively at various levels and in different contexts to generate harms to health and health inequities. On terrain more typical for bioethics, clinical and other care settings, as currently configured, are notoriously disorienting, anxiety-inducing, and in some ways dangerous for physical, psychological, and existential health. Researchers have detailed a range of effects of institutional design, including the effects of noise and light on recovery times, and the ways architecture can shape interactions and experiences. Long-term care settings are infamous for poor conditions. A lack of light, private space, and access to the outdoors, for example, and isolation from broader social surroundings, adversely affect the health of elderly people. People fleeing war, persecution, and famine endure desperate conditions that threaten health. Many reside in camps (in the form of transit camps and official refugee camps, detention centers, etc. ) while others dwell in slums or other settlements - primarily in urban areas - segregated from the majority population. These people suffer from a range of complex physical and mental health conditions. Before or during transit and in camps and other settings, they face food insecurity, risk of communicable disease, fear, violence, loss, and other experiences. If there is access to health services it is often restricted to acute medical care, and not equipped to adequately address chronic or mental health conditions or the social determinants of health needs. Migrants and asylum-seeking people thus lack crucial capabilities to be healthy. It is not that a relationship between place and health is a modern epiphany. Hippocrates' Airs, waters, and places, the epidemiological work of Louis-Rene Villerme and Rudolph Virchow in the 19th century, and the histories of public health and urban planning, all recognized the importance of environmental conditions. The asylums for the mentally ill in the late 19th century reveal an attention, if not yet evidence-based, for place in care and healing. Inspired by the Moral Treatment movement, New Enlightenment intellectuals, and health advocates like Dorthea Dix, Thomas Kirkbride established professional guidelines on institutional layout and room design for patients. Realist methods in social epidemiology, more recently, have deepened our appreciation and understanding of the processes at work on our corporeal nature, and our entanglement with the world around us. We are situated socially, materially, and geographically, and vulnerable as creatures who need care and who also need to 'fit' with the places in which we dwell and through which we navigate. We are, in short, ecological subjects, beings for whom social interdependence and geographic locatedness are vital. As I will argue below, health justice, or the capability to be healthy, therefore demands thoughtful attention to place and the conditions that create and sustain places. In the next section, I explain the relationship between recognizing people as ecological subjects and the ideal and practice of solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it, refers to reaching out through engaging our moral imaginations across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to recognize and assist others who are vulnerable, in some cases, acutely, and, over time, advance justice. As a practice, solidarity involves two core 'enacted commitments'. The first commitment is to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need, or what I will describe below as solidaristic recognition. The second commitment is to responsive action. This hybrid definition draws upon the inspirational work of Iris Marion Young, Carol Gould, Fuyuki Kurasawa, and Prainsack and Buyx, all of whom build upon a long and rich history of interpretations of solidarity. Recognizing the suffering of the displaced and others who are 'implaced' in conditions unable to sustain them follows from the most minimal appreciation of people as ecological subjects, relational creatures who are densely enmeshed in social relations as well as spatial locations. While my analysis differs substantially, to describe this here I use Carol Gould's term, 'solidaristic recognition'. Gould distinguishes between what she calls 'rigorous recognition' and 'generous recognition'. Rigorous recognition appreciates the equality of all people through an essentially cognitive process involving an acknowledgment of our fellow humanity. The generous genre, which she recasts as 'solidaristic recognition', involves empathy, or an affective link with others, and focuses on our 'mutual interdependence and common needs'. Solidaristic recognition conceives of others as 'equal in their difference', that is, their distinctive social group membership and individual particularity. On my own interpretation, solidaristic recognition has two varieties, neither of which relies on empathy: basic and relational, responsible recognition. If we conceive of people in ecological terms, basic recognition (similar to Gould's 'rigorous recognition') might be expanded beyond its appreciation of everyone's equal moral worth to take account of the significance of place for the equitable flourishing of all ecological subjects. This most basic form of recognition acknowledges that we are equal in part because we all share a need to be 'in place' in settings that can sustain us and support our capacities. A second, more ethically responsible, form of recognition I will call relational solidaristic recognition emerges from reckoning more thoroughly with our radically relational nature as ecological subjects. This reckoning demands that we conceive of ourselves and others as embedded but also that we understand that we are constitutive of one another and our environs. Geographers have described this in terms of the intersubjectivity of identity and place. In her philosophical account of ecological subjectivity, Lorraine Code underscores the idea that we are 'made by and making [our] relations in [asymmetrical] reciprocity with other subjects and with horizontal ellipsis multiple, diverse locations'. Seeing not just identities, but also, critically, place in relational terms, highlights 'the variety of interactions between people who are located differently that go into making places'. As Iris Young puts it, we 'dwell together' in 'complex, causal' relations of interdependence and in specific atmospheric and material conditions on earth in geographic regions and neighborhoods, in homes, and institutions of care and employment. We ecological subjects, then, contribute to the construction of place - often unintentionally - through actions and interactions within a larger context of social structures and processes. These structures and processes serve to enable some people in the realization of their capacities, yet constrain others, creating and/or sustaining structural injustice. This is evidenced, for example, in urban planning policies that spawn residential segregation or global economic and trade policies that compel health care workers to migrate and deepen health inequities in source countries. While basic solidaristic recognition can allow for or has the potential to generate ethical place-making, relational recognition understands the ways that our own subjectivities, identities, and places of dwelling as ecological subjects are formed in relation to other identities in other places and, crucially, that this generates responsibilities for justice. It is in this sense that relational solidaristic recognition is a more responsible form: it appreciates better-situated ecological subjects' contributions to the injustice suffered by the displaced or precariously placed, and aspires to respond and work toward promoting justice. Responsiveness , an important epistemic and, in turn, ethical capacity, is a crucial element for enactments of solidarity in the view I want to develop. Both Joan Tronto and Elise Springer assign 'responsiveness' a prominent place in their work. Springer situates 'responsiveness' within virtue ethics. On her view, it involves a kind of adaptability, particularly in unfamiliar moral terrain, or in the face of concerns that 'resist clear representation'. Springer posits responsiveness as also involving a commitment to 'extend a temporally continuous thread of attention' or giving one's moral attention over time, not episodically or reactively. Tronto identifies responsiveness as one of four ethical elements of care, casting it as a moral capacity that involves vigilance 'to the possibilities for abuse that arise with vulnerability'. I would add another element as integral to responsiveness, drawn specifically from ecological epistemology: an ability to show finely tuned sensitivity to context, that is, the particularity of people and circumstance, and give attention and action that is fitting. Solidarity, enacted, should emerge from a disposition committed to responsiveness understood in terms of these capacities, if it is to meet the mark. In the next section I turn to responsive action that arises from solidaristic recognition, in particular, efforts at place-making for the displaced. Innovation, inspired by ecological thinking and increasingly evidence-based, is underway. 'Place-making' is a set of intentional practices spanning different disciplines that targets neighborhoods, parks and paths, features of landscape, housing developments, streetscapes, long-term care facilities, and hospitals. With and without attention to health, it is either referenced explicitly or somehow central to key international documents and declarations including the Sustainable Development Goals and UN Habitat's New Urban Agenda. It is on the agendas of the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), even the World Bank, some think tanks and foundations, and a major US corporation. Public health leaders point to place-based interventions as 'the new frontier'. In other work I have interpreted ethical place-making, a notion that first surfaced in the geography literature, as a core component of an enabling, capabilities-oriented conception of justice. Grounded in ecological thinking and an ecological conception of persons, ethical place-making understands all people as embedded socially and spatially, and often enmeshed in relationships of structural injustice that threaten health. Key elements of ethical place-making include: nurturing relations of care and interdependence; protecting bodily integrity; supporting autonomy, not interpreted in terms of individual self-reliance, but in the relational sense that sees us as originating, persisting, and flourishing within relations of care and interdependence, given ongoing opportunities for self-directed thought and action; promoting stability and a sense of rootedness and, at the same time, supporting generative movement; and finally, where necessary, responding to inequities. Below I offer selected examples of place-making drawn from a range of domains pertinent to bioethics. After describing them, I explain why they count as instances of ethical place-making inspired by (and potentially generating more) solidaristic recognition and how they stand to promote - especially health - justice and in some cases address health inequities. I start at the level of community and public health with an urban planning example, and from there, turn to a clinical and then a long-term care setting. These three case studies come from the global north. The final examples explore (mostly health-centered) place-making efforts in refugee reception and resettlement, sketching innovations in Germany and also Lebanon, a country that borders the war in Syria and ranks fourth worldwide as a host to refugees. Further research will yield additional instances of solidarity and place-making, particularly for health, in other parts of the world. In [a] system of the city as weaving, [creating] crosswise threads enables solidarity, and fundamental to solidarity is the free system of movement horizontal ellipsis 'Intentional shrinkage', 'sorting', and 'serial displacement' are terms given to the urban land use and 'development' policies that systematically shredded the social and material fabric in and around African American neighborhoods in New York City. Public health researchers have linked these policies and the consequent displacement of families, businesses, churches and more, to the AIDS epidemic, addiction, asthma, post-traumatic stress, and obesity. Working together, citizens, planners, and researchers responded with the Giraffe Path (GP), a 6-mile trail from Central Park to the Cloisters. The walking and biking path is a project emerging explicitly from the kind of solidarity described above: the recognition of the city and its people as ecologically embedded, with enduring health inequities as a result of displacements, and responsive action in the form of (re)creating place with and for ecological subjects. The GP is based on a conception of the city and its neighborhoods and residents as interdependent - and is designed to restore connections between formerly fractured communities around and across the Harlem River and, at the same time, to support outdoor physical activity. The closure of the bridge, that had long linked neighbors, as a 'crime-prevention' measure for gentrifying neighborhoods, severed (in a pattern repeated in cities everywhere) relationships between people according to categories of class and race. By (re)connecting places and people and mending - as its designers say, 'weaving', 're-stitching' - the GP helps restore these and cultivate new relations. At the same time, as part of the City Life Is Moving Bodies (CLIMB) Project, the GP's creation of flow and unimpeded movement is being celebrated as 'a victory for the city's entire circulatory system'. The attention paid to (solidaristic recognition of) the importance of place for health and most significantly, health inequities, in this instance of ethical place-making is an exception and not the norm. Urban renewal policies and planning tend to prioritize physical, economic, and social issues, yet few focus explicitly on health or show concern for health equity. Another essential dimension for future solidarity is the potential for political engagement generated by the GP. As Iris Young argues (and the inset quote implies), segregation obscures from the affluent an appreciation of their privilege, and, by limiting interaction, constrains political communication. This erodes the potential for solidarity and perpetuates social injustice. The GP designers aspire to promote solidaristic recognition through facilitating new interactions, forging new relations, and evolving as ecological subjects. We must pay attention to the lived spatial significance of patients' experience of health and illness if we are going to treat them fully and well. Doing so is one step of paying attention to a person horizontal ellipsis The terrain and overall ambience of the clinical setting is famously hostile to non-medical people, notably the ones it exists to serve. Place-centered innovation in hospitals and other centers of care is a growing niche, recognizing the harms done to ecological subjects - here patients and their families - in the 'care' of institutions built as medical assembly lines organized around time until discharge or demise. One neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, U.K., recognizes the importance of place for the health and well-being of vulnerable ecological subjects and puts into practice a concept known as 'secure base', which wraps around patients and families 'like a hug'. The unit's design also demonstrates solidarity with them in recognizing the effects of typical clinical settings and, in contrast, boasts lots of natural light, greatly reduced noise, private nooks, and a horseshoe-shape design that reflects the progression a newborn will take from intensive care to a neonatal room. In this case of ethical place-making, innovators aim to create a habitat that nurtures overlapping relations of care wherein babies sleep longer, and parents are perhaps a little less distressed, and more able to participate in care and interact with clinical care providers. As noted above, the structure of this temporary dwelling enables families to better understand, through their embodied experience, the clinical pathway the infants will follow until discharge, which in turn likely gives a boost to their sense of agency and empowerment and helps to level the playing field with clinicians. Designed by a long-term care nurse in response to her observations and experience of existing institutions, Hogeway Village accommodates elderly people with dementia in a setting meant to resemble a real European neighborhood. It has a market, cafe, salon, theater, sidewalks, and ample green space. Different models, tailored to appeal to specific social and cultural groups, are available. Staff engage with residents without clinical garb and simultaneously provide skilled care. Family members are integrally involved in care plans. Hogeway is built to protect yet not restrict, allowing residents a wide range of movement and access to the outdoors. The availability of palliative care ensures that residents do not have to relocate at the end of life, which allows for continuity of care and relationships. Another benefit is that family members need not navigate new terrains, or settings, of care or transportation as elders' needs evolve. Emerging research on long-term care settings designed more like homes and communities suggests that residents are more socially engaged and active, and experience better overall 'well-being'. Preliminary evidence also suggests that integrating families in care can improve relations with care workers, as well as resident care and health. European cities and regions have demonstrated their horizontal ellipsis willingness to express solidarity with horizontal ellipsis the world's refugees via participation in resettlement. Solidarity is at the moral center of humanitarian action, and place-making by other names has long been integral to humanitarian operations. From an emphasis on emergency and temporary assistance, humanitarians have expanded the scope and practice of 'solidarity' given the nature of current conflicts and the creation of dependencies that may lead to more sustained commitments. Their work now increasingly overlaps with development efforts to bolster host countries' capacities to receive, resettle, and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long term. Solidarity, indeed, is the basis of commitments to refugee resettlement in international humanitarian law. In 2004, the Mexico Plan of Action to Strengthen International Protection of Refugees in Latin America (MPA), which encompassed regional responsibility sharing, the expansion of resettlement space, reception capacity, and long-term integration, highlighted solidarity as a guiding principle for support of refugees from Columbia and their host countries. Northern Europe has been the preferred destination for refugees from Syria and other places where war has driven people from their homes. Germany, especially its cities, hosts more recent asylum-seekers than any other EU nation. Urban areas have absorbed two-thirds of the world's refugees and now face the work of integration. The region offers myriad examples of efforts in ethical place-making spawned by solidaristic recognition. In both Hamburg and Berlin, organizing around place has been a key strategy in welcoming and helping to integrate new arrivals. In Berlin, city planners have employed a strategy of creating container villages to help refugees feel secure and foster a sense of embeddedness-in-community. While formalized, state-administered efforts have unfolded, citizen volunteers have designed innovative responses to link refugees with needed services, helping to integrate them and provide a sense of place. The coordinated state and civil society effort, in particular, is an inspiring example of politically and socially constructed solidarity, supported and advanced by what Christine Straehle calls a 'cosmopolitan avant-garde' of citizens. Hamburg is also innovative in linking services across sectors like food, shelter, education, work skills, and legal advice, appreciating the importance of integrating services for those who have endured profound dispersion and fragmentation. The city addressed housing needs by redesigning existing buildings and engaged local communities in deciding on locations in order to help ensure a welcoming, safe environment and avoid the possibility of local neighborhood resistance. The countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey that serve as the principal hosts to refugees fleeing Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, are organizing around so-called 'resilience' strategies, which aim at bolstering host countries' capacities to accept and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long-term. This management philosophy deserves more sustained discussion. I highlight here another civil society initiative involving ethical place-making. In Lebanon during the war (1975-1990) public spaces were among the most dangerous places. Now they serve as temporary shelter areas for migrants and refugees displaced from neighboring conflict who face fear, discrimination, and violence in their new environs. In this context, one architect saw an opportunity: 'I thought by promoting place-making in Lebanon we can join the efforts of local [civil society] actors, since horizontal ellipsis place-making is based on networking and bringing people together.' With his guidance, youth in Beirut participated in identifying and recreating public spaces with the aims of reducing violence, promoting inclusion, interaction, and community-building. Along with place-making for the sake of social integration, place-based interventions in healthcare services are surfacing in response to contemporary migration patterns. Adapting to the mobility of many displaced people who are, not accessing services in camps, for instance, humanitarian and local actors have reorganized healthcare delivery. The Blue Dot Hubs developed by UNHCR and partners to provide care and services to people en route are a specific example of a response - a place-making intervention to 'changing therapeutic geographies' in modern crises. In the context of resettlement, interventions focused on the creation of 'therapeutic landscapes' aim specifically at displaced children as they resettle in new countries. Through recultivating cultural traditions, building social networks, and creating safe places, young people can create new homes. These examples depict different modes of displacement and distinct populations situated in specific kinds of settings and in particular - yet in all cases asymmetrical - relations of power. In each case, responsive action, keenly sensitive to context, emerges from solidaristic recognition, either basic or relational. In some cases it aims explicitly at justice. We can see specific elements of solidarity-sparked ethical place-making across cases. Support for relations of care is at the heart of the efforts made in the Bath NICU and Hogeway Village designs, and also in the GP and initiatives for refugees. Attention to the need for rootedness and movement is manifested in these civil society efforts to welcome and create material, social, economic, and political space for refugees; it is also an organizing principle for the GP, Hogeway, and Bath's NICU. Transformative autonomy is evident in the GP, the therapeutic landscape projects, Hogeway, and the NICU. Attention to inequities, especially health inequities, motivates the GP and Blue Dot Hubs. In all, the creators - architects, designers, planners, carers, and citizens - recognize the 'users', let us say 'dwellers', as ecological subjects and respond with concerned attention to their distinctive needs, in real time and over time with the aim of supporting their capabilities, chiefly to be healthy, and in some cases to remedy injustice. I have argued that recognizing all people as ecological subjects enables us, indeed compels us, to forge relations of solidarity and promote justice through ethical place-making with those who are vulnerable through their insecure relationship to place. On the moral landscape(s) of bioethics, an ethic of place-making expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity along with advancing health, social, and global justice with patients and families, elderly people transitioning to long-term care, urban populations confronting health inequities, asylum-seekers dwelling in precarious conditions, and perhaps others.

INTRODUCTION PLACE AND HEALTH: ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTS ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTIVITY AND SOLIDARITY Solidaristic recognition Responsiveness SOLIDARITY (AND HEALTH JUSTICE) ENACTED: ETHICAL PLACE-MAKING Community and public health Care settings Refugee assistance and integration The elements of ethical place-making CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes Drawing on a conception of people as 'ecological subjects', creatures situated in specific social relations, locations, and material environments, I want to emphasize the importance of place and place-making for basing, demonstrating, and forging future solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it here, involves reaching out through moral imagination and responsive action across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to assist other people who are vulnerable, and to advance justice. Contained in the practice of solidarity are two core 'enacted commitments', first, to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need and, second, to responsive action. Recognizing the suffering of displacement and responding through place-making should follow from even the most simplistic understanding of people as 'implaced'. Recognition, furthermore, that places are created and sustained, transformed, or neglected in ways that foster or perpetuate inequities, including health inequities, generates responsibilities concerning place-making. Place-based interventions, on either count, should be principal and, indeed, prioritized ways of showing solidarity for the vulnerable and promoting justice. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, place-making can catalyze and nurture them, and over time advance justice. On the moral landscapes of bioethics, the terrain where care and health are or should be at the center of attention, an ethic of place and place-making for those who have been displaced - patients, the elderly, urban populations, and asylum-seekers, for instance - expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity.
52	The evolution of dengue viruses has resulted in four antigenically similar yet distinct serotypes. Infection with one serotype likely elicits lifelong immunity to that serotype, but generally not against the other three. Secondary or sequential infections are common, as multiple viral serotypes frequently cocirculate. Dengue infection, although frequently mild, can lead to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) which can be life threatening. DHF is more common in secondary dengue infections, implying a role for the adaptive immune response in the disease. There is currently much effort toward the design and implementation of a dengue vaccine but these efforts are made more difficult by the challenge of inducing durable neutralizing immunity to all four viruses. Domain 3 of the dengue virus envelope protein (ED3) has been suggested as one such candidate because it contains neutralizing epitopes and it was originally thought that relatively few cross-reactive antibodies are directed to this domain. In this study, we performed a detailed analysis of the anti-ED3 response in a cohort of patients suffering either primary or secondary dengue infections. The results show dramatic evidence of original antigenic sin in secondary infections both in terms of binding and enhancement activity. This has important implications for dengue vaccine design because heterologous boosting is likely to maintain the immunological footprint of the first vaccination. On the basis of these findings, we propose a simple in vitro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to diagnose the original dengue infection in secondary dengue cases.
53	Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe characteristics of perinatally HIV-infected adolescents (PHIVAs), factors associated with mortality, and outcomes at transition. Design: Ongoing observational database collating clinical data on HIV-infected children and adolescents in Asia. Methods: Data from 2001 to 2016 relating to adolescents (10-19 years) with perinatal HIV infection were analysed to describe characteristics at adolescent entry and transition and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimens across adolescence. A competing risk regression analysis was used to determine characteristics at adolescent entry associated with mortality. Outcomes at transition were compared on the basis of age at cART initiation. Results: Of 3448 PHIVA, 644 had reached transition. Median age at HIV diagnosis was 5.5 years, cART initiation 7.2 years and transition 17.9 years. At adolescent entry, 35.0% had CD4(+) cell count less than 500 cells/ml and 51.1% had experienced a WHO stage III/IV clinical event. At transition, 38.9% had CD4(+) cell count less than 500 copies/ml, and 53.4% had experienced a WHO stage III/IV clinical event. Mortality rate was 0.71 per 100 person-years, with HIV RNA >= 1000 copies/ml, CD4(+) cell count less than 500 cells/ml, height-for-age or weight-for-age z-score less than -2, history of a WHO stage III/IV clinical event or hospitalization and at least second cART associated with mortality. For transitioning PHIVA, those who commenced cART age less than 5 years had better virologic and immunologic outcomes, though were more likely to be on at least second cART. Conclusion: Delayed HIV diagnosis and cART initiation resulted in considerable morbidity and poor immune status by adolescent entry. Durable first-line cART regimens to optimize disease control are key to minimizing mortality. Early cART initiation provides the best virologic and immunologic outcomes at transition.

54	In response to the 2013 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics, the Future Circular Collider (FCC) study was launched, as an international collaboration hosted by CERN. This study covers a highest-luminosity high-energy lepton collider (FCC-ee) and an energy-frontier hadron collider (FCC-hh), which could, successively, be installed in the same 100 km tunnel. The scientific capabilities of the integrated FCC programme would serve the worldwide community throughout the 21st century. The FCC study also investigates an LHC energy upgrade, using FCC-hh technology. This document constitutes the second volume of the FCC Conceptual Design Report, devoted to the electron-positron collider FCC-ee. After summarizing the physics discovery opportunities, it presents the accelerator design, performance reach, a staged operation scenario, the underlying technologies, civil engineering, technical infrastructure, and an implementation plan. FCC-ee can be built with today's technology. Most of the FCC-ee infrastructure could be reused for FCC-hh. Combining concepts from past and present lepton colliders and adding a few novel elements, the FCC-ee design promises outstandingly high luminosity. This will make the FCC-ee a unique precision instrument to study the heaviest known particles (Z, W and H bosons and the top quark), offering great direct and indirect sensitivity to new physics.
55	Earthworms are an important soil taxon as ecosystem engineers, providing a variety of crucial ecosystem functions and services. Little is known about their diversity and distribution at large spatial scales, despite the availability of considerable amounts of local-scale data. Earthworm diversity data, obtained from the primary literature or provided directly by authors, were collated with information on site locations, including coordinates, habitat cover, and soil properties. Datasets were required, at a minimum, to include abundance or biomass of earthworms at a site. Where possible, site-level species lists were included, as well as the abundance and biomass of individual species and ecological groups. This global dataset contains 10,840 sites, with 184 species, from 60 countries and all continents except Antarctica. The data were obtained from 182 published articles, published between 1973 and 2017, and 17 unpublished datasets. Amalgamating data into a single global database will assist researchers in investigating and answering a wide variety of pressing questions, for example, jointly assessing aboveground and belowground biodiversity distributions and drivers of biodiversity change.
