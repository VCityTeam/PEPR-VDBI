Résumé du projet  en français  (Non Confidentiel – 4000 caractère s maximum, 
espaces inclu s) 
Les villes adoptent des politiques efficaces en matière de biodiversité et de perméabilité s’appuyant 
sur des solutions basées sur la natur e pour conserver, restaurer et améliorer les sols et la végétation 
urbains afin de relever les défis comme la surchauffe ou l'atténuation des inondations, l'amélioration 
de la santé physique et mentale des résidents, la réduction de la pollution des sols, de l'air et de 
l'eau, ainsi que la protection et la restauration de la biodiversité et des écosystèmes fonctionnels. 
Ces politiques d'aménagement urbain, résumées en "vertes, fraîches et perméables", sont 
essentielles à la transition écologique vers des vi lles durables. Cependant, l'étalement urbain, en 
convertissant des terres agricoles et naturelles, a eu un impact négatif sur la biodiversité et la 
production alimentaire, sur les structures sociales et a augmenté les émissions de CO2 des réseaux 
de transp ort. Les modèles de villes compactes mis en œuvre par le biais de législations telles que 
l'objectif "net -no-land-take 2050" en France pourraient entrer en conflit avec les modèles verts en 
densifiant les habitations existantes et planifiées. Les espaces v erts résidentiels (EVR) des 
logements individuels et collectifs sont souvent considérés comme artificiels et responsables de 
l'étalement urbain, et donc en danger. Les EVR, seuls ou à l’échelle du quartier, ont le potentiel de 
fournir les services attendus  dans une ville durable et verte. Mais ces services sont -ils suffisants au 
regard des dommages causés par l'étalement urbain ? Les objectifs du projet VILLEGARDEN sont 
(1) d'évaluer la performance écologique des EVR (2) d'évaluer les facteurs environnement aux et 
sociaux déterminant la performance, afin de trouver des solutions pour améliorer la planification, la 
conception et la gestion des EVR, (3) de confronter les résultats des modèles spatialement 
explicites aux documents de planification actuels. Ces o bjectifs seront réalisés par un consortium 
national (9 villes : Angers, Dijon, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier, Nancy, Nantes, Paris et Toulouse) 
composé de spécialistes des sciences les autorités territoriales, les associations, les bailleurs 
sociaux, les en treprises et, surtout, les citoyens. La performance peut être mesurée et ses facteurs 
explicatifs explorés à différentes échelles. VILLEGARDEN est donc organisé en trois lots basés sur 
les échelles. Le WP1 étudie les processus et les facteurs à l'échelle d e la ville (végétation, foncier, 
environnement et social) réunis dans un projet SIG couvrant six villes. Dans le WP2, la performance 
sera mesurée à l'aide d'indicateurs de sol et de biodiversité, ainsi que la perception de la 
performance par les résidents dans 200 EVR dans les six villes. Dans le WP3, les processus à 
l'échelle du quartier tels que les relations avec les espaces verts publics, les pratiques de jardinage, 
les caractéristiques des réseaux écologiques invisibles sur les photographies aériennes seront 
explorés. La compréhension de la performance et de ses facteurs déterminants permettra une 
modélisation innovante des services écologiques des EVR (p.ex., support de la biodiversité, 
perméabilité du sol, évapotranspiration, bien -être) à l'échelle de  la ville. Cette modélisation, 
confrontée aux documents de planification, pourrait améliorer la performance de l'ensemble de 
l'infrastructure verte et avoir des répercussions profondes sur l'habitabilité des villes pour les êtres 
humains et la biodiversité . VILLEGARDEN vise également à co -construire avec les parties 
prenantes : cela sera abordé dans des forums, qui seront des centres d'échange en ligne et en 
personne (sur les retours d’expérience et les perspectives urbaines, sur les sols et sur la 
biodiver sité). VILLEGARDEN travaillera aussi en synergie avec les scientifiques et acteurs urbains 
des projets liés ANR et PEPR actuels. Notre projet intégrera pleinement la communauté VDBI du 
PEPR en travaillant étroitement avec ses centres opérationnels.

Résumé du projet en anglais (Non Confidentiel – 4000 caractères maximum, 
espaces inclus)  
Cities adopt efficient biodiverse and permeable policies wh ich increasingly rely on nature based 
solutions (NBS) to conserve, restore and improve urban soils and vegetation to address urban 
challenges such as overheating or flood mitigation, improvement of physical and mental health of 
residents, reduction of soil , air and water pollution, as well as protection and restoration of functional 
biodiversity and ecosystems. Such urban planning policies, which could be summarized as “green, 
cool and permeable” policies, are central to the ecological transition to sustain able cities. However, 
excessive land -take by cities, i.e. urban sprawl, by converting agricultural and natural lands, has 
negatively impacted biodiversity and food production, affected social structures and increased the 
emissions of greenhouse gases from transportation networks. Compact city models implemented 
through legislation such as the net -no-land-take 2050 in France might conflict with green models by 
densifying extant as well as planned housing. The residential greenspaces (RGS) of single - and 
multifamily homes are often considered artificialized and responsible for urban sprawl, and therefore 
at risk. RGS have been shown singly or as part of suburbs, to have the potential to deliver the 
services expected in a sustainable, green city. But are they g ood enough when considering the 
damages caused by sprawl? The objectives of the VILLEGARDEN project are (1) to assess the 
ecological performance of RGS (2) to evaluate environmental and social factors determining 
performance, in order to find solutions to improve RGS planning, design and management, (3) to 
confront the results from spatially explicit models to current planning documents. These objectives 
will be carried out by a 9 -city (Angers, Dijon, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier, Nancy, Nantes, Paris and 
Toulouse) nationwide consortium of social scientists (sociology, geography, urban planning), soils 
scientists and ecologists, working with urban stakeholders including territorial authorities, 
associations, social housing landlords, private companies and mo st important, citizens, as 
residents, owners or users of RGS. Performance can be measured and its explanatory factors 
explored at different scales. VILLEGARDEN is therefore organized in three scientific work packages 
based on scales: WP1 looks at city scal e processes and factors, based on vegetation, ownership, 
environmental and social geographic layers joined in a project GIS covering six cities. In WP2, 
performance will be measured using soil and biodiversity indicators as well as performance 
perception b y stakeholders, in 200 RGS in six cities. In WP3, neighborhood -scale processes such 
a relationships with public greenspaces, gardening and landscaping practices, features of 
ecological networks invisible from aerial photography (e.g. walls, domestic animal s) will be explored. 
Understanding performance and its determining factors will allow innovative modeling of RGS 
ecological services (e.g. biodiversity support, soil permeability, evapotranspiration, Human well -
being) at city -scale. This, when confronted w ith planning documents, could improve the 
performance of the entire green infrastructure and have deep -reaching impacts on city livability for 
Humans and biodiversity. VILLEGARDEN is also about co -constructing knowledge and methods 
with stakeholders: this will be addressed using long -term online and in -person exchange hubs we 
call forums (on urban feedbacks and perspectives, on soils and on biodiversity). VILLEGARDEN 
will work in synergy with current linked ANR and PEPR projects that provide scientific and 
stakeholder support. It will fully integrate the PEPR VDBI community by closely working with its 
operational centers.

Contexte, objectifs  et caractère innovant du projet  
Societal and environmental context.  Humanity is facing the three simultaneous global crises of 
the Anthropocene. Climate change is accelerating, biodiversity is collapsing, and planetary 
habitability is in jeopardy for Humans and non -Humans alike, in part because of the first two crises1. 
Urbanization, understood as a global, pervasive phenomenon, is r esponsible for all three crises1. 
Humans and non -Humans in urban areas are also the most impacted, as they face a concentration 
of all three crises in their everyday lives. It is necessary for urban Humans to find solutions to make 
their local environment livable for biodiversity and for themselves2, and to limit their global impact on 
all three fronts. The urban environment is also a catalyst and frontrunner of development and 
innovation, and one way forward is for cities to adopt efficient biodiverse and permeable policies 
(aka “green” policies)2. These policies increasingly rely on nature based solutions (NBS) seeking to 
conserve, restore and improve urban soils and vegetation to address urban challenges such as 
overheating or flood mitigation, improvemen t of physical and mental health of residents, reduction of 
soil, air and water pollution, as well as protection and restoration of functional biodiversity and 
ecosystems3 . Such urban planning policies, which could be summarized as “green, cool and 
permeab le” policies, are central to the ecological transition to sustainable cities4. However, excessive 
land-take by cities, i.e. urban sprawl, by converting agricultural and natural lands5, has negatively 
impacted biodiversity and food production, affected soci al structures and increased the emissions of 
greenhouse gases from transportation networks6. In France, population increase (+19% 1981 -2019) 
has resulted in non -linearly increased sprawl (+70% urban surface 1981 -2019), of which +42% are 
due to new resident ial areas 7. 
Urban sprawl, artificialization and the French context.  To reduce urban sprawl and its impacts, 
denser urbanization models such as the “compact city” now influence planners at all territorial 
scales8. Conciliating “compact” and “green” models for sustainability has been described both as a 
dilemma (i.e. grey vs green development) and a paradox (i.e. local vs regional livability) 9, leading to 
reduced greenspace, most often by diminishing residential greenspaces. Residential greenspaces 
(RGS) ar e used by residents of single -family or multi -family housing for recreation, food -production 
and urban nuisance reduction. In French urban areas, RGS make up the largest share of total 
greenspace surface. For instance, in the Métropole de Lyon, public gree n surfaces make up 25.44% 
of total green surfaces (roads sides and unused plots not counted) vs 35.26% for single -family and 
9.1% for multi -family residential housing10. At a broader scale, single -family RGS account for >50% 
of urban green surfaces in the Ile-de-France 11. Despite their seemingly obvious role in keeping cities 
biodiverse, permeable and cool, despite their high demand by citizens, but because of compact city 
strategies, RGS are today under threat of rapid shrinkage and further artificializat ion (i.e. land -take) 
12. Densification often means turning single -family into multi -family housing with a much lower 
household/green surface ratio, or building new single -family units on RGS. This results in lower 
overall greening, with diminished ecosyste m services from soils13 and biodiversity 14. Public GS 
cannot compensate for these losses simply because their surfaces are insufficient 12. In France, 
compact models are encapsulated in the “zero -net artificialization 2050” national target, drawn under 
the law “climate and resilience” of 2021 15. Among other objectives, this law seeks to stop urban 
sprawl and strongly limit new artificial surfaces. It is based on an ecological concept of  PEPR  VBDI

artificialization: "the lasting alteration of all or part of a soil's  ecological functions, in particular its 
biological, hydric and climatic functions, as well as its agronomic potential, as a result of the land -
use". An additional decree 16 provides a simple and clear taxonomy, in which agricultural surfaces, 
forests, pub lic parks and gardens are considered non -artificialized. Any green surface below 
2500m2, any linear green surface <5m in width, any residential, commercial or industrial green 
surface with less than 25% tree cover, are considered artificialized.  
What is kn own on RGS.  The contributions of RGS to livability remain mostly unassessed in a 
France or continental Europe, which is worrisome in a context where compact city models are fast 
gaining hold 8. The implications of the afore -mentioned taxonomy are numerous and question the 
existence of RGS, as most single -family and many multiple -family RGS are <2500m2 and <25% tree 
cover. The law recognizes 7 drivers for achieving the 2050 objective, including optimizing the density 
of urban areas to preserve natural soils.  Mechanically, this means that new development realized 
on already artificial surfaces should be preferred, esp. if they increase urban density. If RGS are 
considered artificial, and as they occupy a large surface area, they would make prime opportunities 
for development. It is difficult to assess how such perspectives would affect livability for city residents, 
but there is a risk of an ecological vicious circle, where well -intended regulations make situations 
worse17. 
The potential of RGS to fulfill “all or part of soil’s ecological function” as well as support significant 
biodiversity has never been systematically assessed in France. Most studies were carried out in the 
UK where single -family RGS account for most urban sufaces 18 . Overall, single -family RGS have 
been found to make cities more biodiverse and permeable 19. They improve people wellbeing and 
health 20, shelter significant biodiversity 21, favor pollinators 22 and could boost functional connectivity 
(i.e. the capacity of landscapes connect hab itat patches for different biodiversity taxa) 23. Garden 
soils can increase performance for ecosystem services with time and careful management, from 
urban technosols (compacted soils with little biological activity) to rich hortisols 24. 
However, some aut hors have pointed caveats, both at plot and city scale, regarding RGS 
performance. RGS biodiversity was lower in less affluent neighborhoods probably due to smaller 
garden area and limited access to plant diversity25. A worrisome reduction in RGS surface a nd tree 
cover, hinting at performance reduction for biodiversity, permeability and cooling, has been detected 
in the UK 18. Gardens were not sufficient to support landscape connectivity for shrews and above -
ground arthropods, arguing for a multi -scale appr oach to better understand and enhance RGS soil 
biodiversity 23. At neighborhood or city scale, suburbs with significant RGS surface have been shown 
to have higher biodiversity than both inner -city and close -by agricultural landscapes22. Biodiversity 
and ot her ecosystem services were not studied in multi -family housing RGS, an even larger 
knowledge -gap to fill, as these are supposed to increase to a larger share of green surfaces. 
Measuring the importance of RGS at city -scale has also not been done, as it re quires crossing rarely 
available data, such as plot typology (e.g. residency vs other uses, single vs multifamily) with high -
resolution, multi -stratum vegetation data as well as plot specific data.  
What is to be explored.  We therefore urgently need to asse ss the role of RGS for livability of 
Humans and biodiversity. How do RGS fulfill ecosystem services at plot scale, where people and 
biodiversity carry out their everyday lives? And what about broader scales, i.e. neighborhood scales 
where public and reside ntial plans and management are decided, or urban -scales where urban -heat 
islands, air pollutants and flooding are generated, and where major planning decisions are made?  
Objectives and main approaches of VILLEGARDEN , and relevance for the PEPR VDBI.  The 
project VILLEGARDEN will address these major knowledge gaps. We hypothesize that, while all 
types of RGS participate in delivering ecosystem services at all scales, there is a huge variability of  PEPR  VBDI

 11 
situations, determined by a large number of social, environme ntal or geographic factors. This 
expected variability should not be perceived as an unworkable mess, but as a rich source of 
examples and inspiration for innovation and improvement of RGS, individually and as part of urban 
green infrastructures.  
Through a pluridisciplinary approach co -constructed with urban stakeholders, we will assess RGS 
performance regarding soil and biodiversity ecosystem services. After  determining which 
social and environmental factors affect performance,  we will seek to  improve perfo rmance of 
RGS considering stakeholder and environmental processes at plot, neighborhood and urban scales.  
PEPR VDBI Objectives.  VILLEGARDEN will endeavor to produce pluridisciplinary, innovative, 
broadly applicable research that help urban stakeholders ove rcome obstacles toward more 
sustainable cities, filling knowledge gaps that prevent action. The project is also about building and 
animating a nationwide community of researchers and stakeholders to find solutions to major issues 
of sustainability. These a re PEPR VDBI’s core objectives.  
Innovation . VILLEGARDEN’s consortium of 80+ environmental and social researchers from 9 
French urban areas, along with their territorial, associative and company partners, will establish a 
broad long -term community with exch anges across professions, disciplines and territories. Building 
such a community is prerequisite for interdisciplinarity science, itself considered a hothouse for 
innovation and the only solution to the “world’s biggest problems”26. Innovation will also sp ring from 
cutting -edge technical choices, by using automated interview transcripts, relying on eDNA methods, 
AI supported sensors and geomatics, as well as citizen sciences, to collect, organize and analyze 
data.  
1.2. Main previous achievements / Principales r éalisations antérieures  
Given the objectives and pluridisciplinary nature of VILLEGARDEN, we have mobilized experts who 
have been involved in pluridisciplinary research on urban environments and societies for years and 
even decades. They have coordinated (or participated to) many French ANR and European H2020 
projects on subjects pertaining to VILLEGARDEN’s objectives (current projects found in linked 
projects table). All teams have published numerous books or articles in international or French -
speaking j ournals (see Publications Annex for a selected list of recent works). Since our consortium 
is large, it is only possible to highlight some of the most remarkable and relevant achievements of 
some of our teams as well as the diversity of expertise making VI LLEGARDEN objectives 
achievable.  
Participation  in “Climate and resilience ” law-making . Ten VILLEGARDEN participants have taken 
part, as co -pilot (B. Bechet - LEE-Nantes) or experts, in a 2017 national expertise on soil 
artificialization, the results of which constituted a  major scientific reference for the "climate and 
resilience" law, and some contributed to the ar ticles o n land -take of the law.  
Considering RGS in urban planning . E. Charmes (EVS -Lyon) has contributed to the national debate 
on densification vs periurbaniza tion, showing how complex the French situation had become and 
the risks posed by densification to quality of life27. Also in Lyon, M. Bourgeois and B. Kaufmann (with 
T. Boutreux) have investigated the place of multifamily housing and RGS in planning polici es in the 
Métropole de Lyon, showing (based on the analysis of >11000 plots) that densification could be 
compatible with sustainable greening only under certain scenarios demanding strong regulations on 
minimal RGS surfaces10. R. Merlot (BAGAP -Angers) has shown how regulation and governance can 
affect biodiversity in periurban planning.  
Representations and perception of urban biodiversity by stakeholders . Both R. Melot and M. Cottet 
(EVS -Lyon) have used interviews and other methodologies (sensible experience  such as sound or  PEPR  VBDI

vision) to understand how stakeholders, esp. the public, consider biodiversity in different contexts 
(e.g. along rivers, streets or parks).  
Geography of urban greenspaces and ecological networks . S. Darly (LADYSS -Paris), in the PSDR 
“Cap IDF” project on land governance has developed a reliable method to map vegetable gardens 
using image classification methods. With their teams,  M. Bourgeois and B. Kaufmann have 
produced a time series of  high -resolution vegetation maps for the Métropole d e Lyon, with 2 or 5 
vegetation strata (http://www.webarmature.fr/ ; https://collectifs -biodiversite.universite -lyon.fr/carte -
dynamique -vegetation/). These were required to model the role of multifamily RGS in ecological 
networks, which are shown to be spec ies and location dependent (i.e. RGS in dense neighborhoods 
contributing little to connectivity). This approach will be used in VILLEGARDEN, but for all types of 
RGS and all cities. A. Vergnes (CEFE -Montpellier) was one of the precursors in urban connectiv ity 
studies, and he showed the importance of gardens and hedge networks for some, but not all taxa 
investigated (ground beetles, shrews)23. 
Urban above and below ground biodiversity . Both teams at CEFE (Montpellier), AgroEcology (Dijon) 
and ESE (Paris) have  published groundbreaking articles on urban biodiversity 22,23. They have also 
participated in elaborating or using citizen science protocols (e.g. http://qubs.fr , with A. Auclerc at 
LSE). A. Vergnes (CEFE) is currently ma naging the BISES ANR project on soil biodiversity, which 
constitutes the methodological basis for VILLEGARDEN’s soil biodiversity sampling. E. Baudry 
(ESE) is managing the GARLAND ANR project on single -family gardens, where she will use her 
published proto cols to assess pollinator presence and function. B. Kaufmann, M. Bourgeois and T. 
Lengagne have sampled 40 RGS in Lyon for all levels of biodiversity, using soil eDNA, organism 
DNA metabarcoding and acoustic sensors (COLLECTIFS project). An expert in bioac oustics (e.g. 
PUBLI) T. Lengagne is currently testing a new generation of AI equipped sensors (ANR SylvanIA) 
that would allow automatic identification of birds, and that VILLEGARDEN will use. At LEPD 
(Marseille) M. Deschamps -Cottin has been working has designed an urban park focused 
(https://www.univ -amu.fr/fr/public/parc -urbain -des-papillons ), an importan t full-size experiment for 
improving RGS in VILLEGARDEN.  
Soils functioning . Around twenty research projects involving VILLEGARDEN partners (members of 
the Urbasols national group on urban soils, LEE -UGE, CEREMA -TEAM, LEM, LSE, EPHor, iEES, 
DYNAFOR, CEREGE) have been undertaken over the last 10 years to produce knowledge on soils 
and their multifunctionality and discuss their inclusion in development projects and urban planning 
(ex. PLUm). Methodologies and tools (like UQualisol, Destisol, MUSE) were co -creat ed with private 
actors and cities. These projects have led to the novel acquisition of data on agronomic quality and 
soil pollution in several of VILLEGARDEN's areas. These data have been included in national 
databases (e.g. BdSolU BRGM, IGCS INRAe) and us ed to implement the tools developed (e.g. 
MUSE methodology by the Maremne Adour Côte -Sud community as part of the ADEME ZAN 
program). G. Séré and LSE in Nancy pioneered research on anthropized soils in general and urban 
soils in particular. Their research about garden soils started by focusing on their specific features 
before leading a national project on urban community gardens (ANR Jassur). Recently they have 
co-developed decision support tools dedicated to the evaluation of the ecological functions and 
ecosystem services provided by urban soils28. X. Le Roux and colleagues at LEM in Lyon have 
developed methods to measure microbial activity and abundances regarding nutrient cycling and 
GHG emissions, applying these to green spaces across the city of Tours  (EC2CO project Forme).   PEPR  VBDI

Design and animation of large stakeholder -academic co -construction initiatives  
All participants in VILLEGARDEN have experience working for and with stakeholders, especially 
when designing or running research projects, but also organ izing events with a broad public. One 
example embodies the ambitions of VILLEGARDEN. M. Lussault (EVS -Lyon) has designed and led 
an innovative urban scale prospective exercise involving the Métropole de Lyon, the town councilors 
and services of 4 cities, p rivate companies (e.g. airport, expo center, large periburban stores and

malls), one university, associations (nature protection, neighborhoods, professional) and farmers. 
The objective was, over a year, to guide 3 urban consulting groups to propose radica l green and 
sustainable plans for 4 cities under industrial transition ( https://www.grandlyon.com/actions/projets -
urbains/grande -porte -des-alpes ). 
2. Detailed project  description  / Description  détaillée  du projet    
2.1. Project outline, scientific strategy  / description du projet , stratégie 
scientifique   
To address the objectives outlined in Fig.1, the VILLEGARDEN project relies on three strategic 
lines  that fully consisten t with the expectations of the PEPR VDBI call:  
(1) to produce science -based reference data  on RGS at plot (>200 RGS), neighborhood and 
urban (>5 urban areas) scales to be integrated in a global project open database (i.e., build up of a 
pluridisciplinary d atabase across planning, geographical, social, biodiversity and soil). This will allow 
true replicability and comparisons between urban areas that are usually documented using different 
methods and metrics. This data will be used to understand which factor s determine RGS 
performance and to model performance at urban scales. This in turn allows integrating RGS explicitly 
in planning, to improve RGS as objects as well as parts of wider green infrastructure. This whole 
sequence has never been implemented at th e scale of VILLEGARDEN, or with such a variety of 
social and environmental indicators.  
(2) to develop exploratory research  on novel stakeholder approaches to RGS improvement, even 
when conducted with lower replication. RGS are extremely variable, and syste matic approaches can 
never capture all aspects, therefore focused research on “hot” topics is essential to avoid missing 
major trends in RGS improvement or mobilization. The results will be used to generate decision -
making tools and information across soci al (i.e. citizen to territorial authorities) and geographical (i.e. 
plot to urban area) scales to help RGS transition toward more biodiversity, soil permeability and 
improved livability.  
(3) to build a long -lasting national interdisciplinary community  of researchers and stakeholders, 
grounded in solid data and shared research work, which can help shape public policy and planning.  
To implement this strategy, we have chosen to mobilize scientists from 20 different laboratories and 
9 urban areas (Fig. 2). This strategy is necessary to incentivize community building and to reach 
stakeholders across the country . For community building, scientists and stakeholders will be invited 
to attend general meetings (kick -off, mid -term and closing meetings) and join three long-term forums . 
Choosing a five -year period means that there will be enough  time to ensure transfer of results and 
conclusions to stakeholders and to a broader public.  
PEPR VDBI  will profit from VILLEGARDEN’s large community, esp. because other projects might 
want to increase their own geographical outreach or analyze data across a larger number of 
disciplines, e.g. climate or pollutio n data and models vs soils and biodiversity. Another support to 
VILLEGARDEN’s ambitions is its strong relationships to linked projects  (annex Table A1). 
2.2. Scientific and technical description of the project / Présentation 
scientifique et technique du projet   
As explained above and in Fig.1, VILLEGARDEN’s objective 1  is to assess the performance  of 
the main types of RGS (single -family vs multifamily) for soil and biodiversity functioning, at plot, 
neighborhood and urban scales. Objective 2  is evaluating which environmental or social factors  
determine performance and using them to model and improve performance at all scales.  Objective 
3 is to confront models to actual planning documents , to produce decision -making tools and  PEPR  VBDI

guides  for all stakeholders. The organization of the project into 3 scale -based scientific work 
packages recognizes that different processes and stakeholders act at different scales, and that data 
production is inherently scale based.  
Objective 1: RGS performanc e assessment  is based on plot scale biodiversity and soil data to be 
collected in >200 RGS in 6 cities (Fig. 2), and compared to baseline data from urban parks managed 
for biodiversity (obtained from ANR BISES and COLLECTIFS). Performance is defined by comparing 
indicator values among RGS, as well as between RGS and urban parks. Performance is measured 
over the following indicators: i) soils : physico -chemistry, structure, agronomical quality, pollutants 
(trace metals, hydrocarbons, pesticides), ii) biodiversity : eDNA diversity and composition of 
bacteria, fungi, soils eucaryotes, earthworms, morphological diversity and composition of collembola 
and plants, citizen -science pollinator diversity (SPIPOLL), automated acoustic diversity of birds, iii)  
ecosy stem functioning : nitrogen cycle bacterial functions, GHG production, tree 
evapotranspiration and health, pollination success, soil indicators of functioning.  
Soil methods are based on Urbasol teams’ experiences and the linked ANR BISES project, which 
was able to characterize 200 samples for public greenspaces. Above -ground biodiversity 
assessment relies on the methods of the ANR GARLAND for pollinators, on the LEHNA and iEES 
for plant diversity/health, on ANR SYLVANIA for automated acoustic sensor methods,  on X. Le 
Roux’s team’s experience for microbial functioning (nitrogen, GHGs). To improve replicability, all 
measurements of the same indicator will be made in a single year (year 2, 2026 or year 3, 2027), or 
over two years for weather dependent functions (e.g. tree health, pollination success). Surveys of 
residents on indicators of performance will be carried out for a subjective assessment of functions 
such as perceived coolness, plant health or soil humidity.  
Objective 2: Factors determining RGS performa nce will be measured or modeled at all scales. 
High-resolution maps will be produced for all urban areas, as in Webarmature and Collectifs (see 
below 3.1), where 1m resolution vegetation maps were produced with 2 (herbaceous vs trees, no 
LIDAR data)  or 5 vegetation classes (herbaceous, shrubs<2m, shrubs 2 -4m, trees 4 -15m, trees>15, 
with LIDAR data). When aerial imagery and LIDAR data are available, vegetation maps will be 
produced for two or three dates (2012, 2018 & 2024 or 2025). Production of these maps  will be 
realized with the support of the national observatory system Observil . New satellite data with both 
high temporal (1 day between images) and spatial (30 -50cm) resolution should becom e available 
within the time frame of the project, and could be used to study day -to-day evolution of soil humidity, 
plant health and evapotranspiration . Spatial data will be used to measure factors (plot plant cover, 
neighborhood and city landscape composition and conformation) for the 200 plots, but als o for all 
RGS within each city by combining vegetation mapping with fiscal plot ownership data on e.g. 
typology (r esidential, commercial or public) and number of households10. Environmental data for 
conditions not measurable at plot level, e.g. urban heat island effect, noise, light, air and soil pollution 
will be mapped using lower resolution data or models. Data on ne ighborhood scale processes such 
as gardening practices, morphological details difficult to obtain from aerial imagery (presence of 
ponds and pools), small impediments to animal movement (e.g. walls) or densities of domestic 
animals will be obtained through  interviews and questionnaires. At plot -scale, garden age (for soil 
and trees) and soil origins, present and past changes in morphology and practices will be recorded. 
The functions of RGS intended by residents encompass recreation, food production, buffer ing urban 
pollutions (e.g. noise, exhaust fumes, neighbors) and aesthetic considerations. Analytical methods 
to sort factors, measure collinearity and explanative power will include multivariate analyses and 
statistical modeling.   PEPR  VBDI

VILLEGARDEN seeks to devel op methods to improve RGS performance . The first source of 
improvement will be found in the expected variability of RGS performance, and the determination of 
factors favoring performance. Additional sources of data and processes for improvement will come 
from interaction with stakeholders, through three focused actions that VILLEGARDEN researchers 
have started in linked projects. In 2022 -2024, the Métropole de Lyon offered financial incentives to 
multifamily housing estates to upgrade their greenspaces with  the advice of professional landscape 
ecologists and paying up to 50% landscaping works by residents or private companies. Fourteen  of 
the 28 multifamily RGS studied for soils and biodiversity in the COLLECTIFS project were included 
in that scheme. We will therefore as sess the effects of the upgrade (using the 14 non -upgraded RGS 
as controls) from an ecological as well as social perspective in 2028, a 4 -6 year interval. Novel 
gardening methods, such as permaculture, designed to protect soils and biodiversity, are gainin g 
traction, but their effect on performance and on intended functions are unclear, this will be explored 
in periurban agglomerations east of Lyon. The cultural background of gardeners influences practices, 
and adoption of new methods (e.g. no pesticides, n o artificial fertilizers, agroforestry); this can be 
hampered by a cultural misalignment between empirical gardeners (i.e. laypersons) and experts, 
which might limit publicly supported effort to improve RGS. Empirical gardeners could also attempt 
novel met hods which experts might find inspiring. This question will be studied with groups of 
communal gardeners in Nantes and the Ile -de-France region.  
Objective 3: Confronting spatially explicit models including RGS with planning documents 
and scenarios  is one o f the most consequential parts of VILLEGARDEN. To investigate how to 
combine green and compact city models, density scenarios with realistic ranges of residential 
morphology and RGS performance will be modeled10. Plot performance data will be used to model 
RSG performance at urban -scale, especially as habitats for wildlife and components of ecological 
networks. The latter will be modeled with Graphab 29 under different scenarios of past and fut ure 
changes (of practices, of conversion to more or less vegetation). These models, along with 
connectivity models, will provide the bases for a prospective approach co -constructed with territorial 
stakeholders in the dedicated forum on “urban feedbacks an d prospective planning”, designed to 
stimulate exchange among researchers and stakeholders from different backgrounds and urban 
areas. Its outcome will be the production of decision -making tools to help stakeholders consider RGS 
ecosystem services using ex plicit models applied to their territories.  
Organization in work packages, tasks and forums.  To implement VILLEGARDEN’s objectives , 
we have organized the project into three  scientific work packages. WPs are simply scale -based 
(WP1=urban scale, WP2=plot scale, WP3=neighborhood) to reflect both the specific processes 
occurring at each scale, and the methods best fitted to inve stigate each scale (see Table 2 ). 
Researchers of all disciplines featured will work together at all t hree scales. Objectives 1 & parts of 
objective 2 are focused on 200 RGS which will be investigated in WP2 from social and ecological 
perspectives (2.1 citizen involvement, 2.2 & 2.3 biodiversity and soils characteristics, 2.4 & 2.5 
biodiversity and soils f unctions/services ). Data on broadscale factors, with the production of a 
complete GIS including social and environmental data will be handled in WP1 (tasks 1.1 & 1.2), as 
will modeling of habitats, connectivity and planning documents (1.3 & 1.4).  WP3 deals with finer, 
more difficult to assess neighborhood processes and intermediate scale actors as described above 
(3.1 neighborhood effects, 3.2 longterm assessment of public incentives to improve RGS, 3.3 
measured and perceived local ecological netw orks, 3.4 novel practices impact on RGS). All WPs are 
led by two researchers from d ifferent disciplines and cities . Each step for each WP will produce  a 
deliverable (Table 2) or is associated with a KPI (Table 1). A WP4 deals with coordination, 
organization of events, data management and communication. Forums are innovative hubs for the  PEPR  VBDI

 17 
exchange of ideas with stakeholders, the production of methods guide and organization of 
workshops  or conferences. Forums run all along the project and are designed to engage all 
participants (and beyond) in a constant reflection on the project themes. Forum 1 is devoted to 
i)feedback from stakeholders on their views and actions on RGS, ii) prospective  workshops where 
RGS data/concepts are explicitly integrated in urban planning, and where academics and 
stakeholders interact to design solutions for and with RGS. Forums 2 and 3 are devoted to soils and 
biodiversity. They will act as places for dialogue w ith stakeholders on the subject, both on methods, 
which some stakeholders need to develop, and on planning. Forums will take place online (through 
website and dedicated participative applications such as discord) and in person, with one forum 
event per yea r at least. The role of each academic partner in WPs and forums is indicated in Table 
2. Participation of nonacademic partners is described in the stakeholders table  (annex) . 
Pluridisciplinarity and institutions.  (Fig. 2) As already mentioned,  the present project is 
plurid isciplinary as it gathers scientists from the Human and Social Sciences (French HCERES 
taxonomy: SHS2_4 Sociology and Demography, SHS3_1 Geography, SHS3_2 Planning), the Life 
and Environmental Sciences (SVE2_LS8 Ecology, SVE2_LS9 Environmental Sciences, Ag ronomy) 
as well as the Sciences and Technologies (ST5 Engineering Sciences). Our approach of RGS is 
holistic and all the data we produce will be of social and environmental nature.  Beyond disciplines, 
the Villegarden consortium gathers 
three of the main national research 
agencies (CNRS for fundamental 
research, INRAé for applied 
agronomic and environmental 
research, IRD for applied overseas 
research), the national research 
agency for territorial units ( CEREMA ), 
engineering schools such as the 
ENTPE, Agr oParisTech, the Institut 
Agro Rennes -Angers , and 8 
universities. This unique diversity of 
institutions will ensure that the project 
will affect  fundamental as well as 
applied research, as well as  urban 
planners and territorial authorities 
nationally.

Links to PEPR VDBI and other projects.  VILLERGARDEN has close ties with other VDBI projects 
such as VF++ and NEO. The project managers of VF++ and VILLEGARDEN currently co -supervise 
a phD linking microclimate modeling  and biodiversity.  Two of the VILLEGARDEN’s partners (B. 
Béchet, C. Le Guern) are also involved in NEO. W e will also interact closely with the PEPR VDBI’s 
operational centers. Our project ’s data scientist will use the infrastructure of the Bordeaux OC on 
data, and also share datasets with the rest of the VDBI community through the OC. Spatial modeling 
and field experim ents are core activities of the current project, and will offer opportunities to share 
methodologies with the Lyon OC. The Marne -la-Vallée OC will be involved  in the Forum on Urban 
Feedbacks and Perspectives to help link VILLEGARDEN to other VDBI projects  with strong urban

planning contents.  Beyond the PEPR VDBI, the current project will work with the three urban living 
labs of the PEPR SOLUBIOD (in Paris, Montpellier and Lyon) in which some of the WP and TS 
leaders are strongly involved . These living la bs, which gather urban stakeholders and researchers 
working on nature -based solutions, will offer local collaboration, access to data and collaborative 
fieldwork opportunities, which will enrich the current project as well as other VDBI projects on climate  
and air pollution.  VILLEGARDEN is linked to a number of current projects, which are described in 
Table A1 in the annex . It is important to emphasize that these projects will build strong synergies 
with VILLEGARDEN, and expend its impacts even further. These linked proj ects group further 
participants and stakeholders, and will add workpower and funding to many actions in 
VILLEGARDEN.  
2.3. Planning, KPI and milestones / Déroulement, indicateurs et jalons  
For KPIs (Table 1) we have chosen quantitative indicat ors, some with targets and milestones when 
appropriate. They are sorted into 6 categories to reflect the project’s intended impacts: For instance, 
“Communication and Outreach” indicators measure how the VILLEGARDEN community mobilizes 
during events, and ho w attractive the project is to stakeholders and non -participant academics. KPIs 
will be displayed on an open dashboard on the project website to ensure all participants and PEPR

B. Kaufmann has led or participated  in a number of local, national or international pluridisciplinary 
projects (see CV below) on the subject of urban biodiversity. As head of the scientific committee of 
the excellency laboratory Intelligence of Urban Worlds (LabEx IMU, 3 years), he has cont ributed to 
award grants (100k -300kE) to >20 pluridisciplinary urban projects. As member of the executive 
committee of the LabEx since 2020, he has helped launch a project incubator (the IMU studios) that 
has given rise to ANR projects as well as 4 projects  for the present VDBI call. He has also supervised 
5 theses that all led to important advances in the fields of landscape and urban ecology, as well as 
producing large datasets on species distributions in urban areas or land -cover maps at very high 
resolut ion. Valorization of research has led to rich websites (webarmature.fr, collectifs -
biodiversite.universite -lyon.fr/) that are currently used by non -academics and researchers alike. On 
top of the LabEx IMU committees, his experience of pluridisciplinarity  stems from project 
cooperation /participation (URBIEAU, ARMATURE, COLLECTIFS, ANR GLOURB) as well as from 
co-supervision of phDs with geographers (A. Bellec, T. Boutreux).  
3.2. Organization of the partnership  / Organisation  du partenariat  
An important element of context for VILLEGARDEN is that it is a merger between two pre -projects 
(Villevivante , on biodiversity  and Solar , on soils ) which had  some  common people and themes. As 
soils and biodiversity both determine ecosystem services, it was logi cal to combine the projects and 
the consortiums. Now VILLEGARDEN gathers >80 scientists from 20 laboratories from 9 different 
French urban areas. All teams involved collaborate with territories, private companies and 
associations. The consortium also impli cates citizens as part of citizen -science projects, social and 
environmental studies with gardeners or through the participation in territorial incentives for citizens.  
We feature most of the French research forces in urban soil sciences (Urbasol network 
https://urbasol.institut -agro-rennes -angers.fr/fr) and urban biodiversity (CEFE laboratory in 
Montpellier, ESE and iEES i n Paris, LEHNA and LEM in Lyon) . In addition,  we have  a strong 
expertise in urban planning (e.g. M. Lussault, E. Charmes), geography (M. Bourg eois) or social 
geography of the environment (M. Cottet, S. Darly). We are supported by current ANR projects 
(BISES lead A. Vergnes, GARLAND lead E. Baudry, PERMEPOLIS lead C. Le Guern), Excellency 
Laboratories (LabEx IMU esp. with projet COLLECTIFS), resea rch federations (CNRS FR2488 
IRSTV headed by B. Béchet, CNRS FR3728 BIOEENVIS headed by X. Le Roux until 2024) and 
initiatives within other PEPR projects (3 urban living labs of the PEPR SOLUBIOD, in Lyon with X. 
Le Roux, in Montpellier with A. Vergnes, an d in Paris where E. Baudry is heading site research in 
Saclay). This is a strong acknowledgement by the research community and by the ANR of the quality 
of the participants in VILLEGARDEN. The project will also benefit from extended expertise networks, 
stakeholder partnerships and up -to-date methodologies developed through all present and past 
initiatives. With experienced researchers leading or having led a number of initiatives, the consortium 
is also well armed to handle the successful management of a la rge PEPR project. A number of 
participants also routinely advise or work with metropolises, cities or urban consultants (e.g. M. 
Lussault, E. Charmes, P. Branchu, B. Kaufmann). Beyond the laboratories, the institutions involved 
in VILLEGARDEN also encompas s a broad diversity of structures, such as universities (e.g. UCB -
Lyon I, UJM -Lyon 3, U -Paris -Saclay, UPV -Montpellier III, U -Lorraine -Nancy), France’s major 
research agencies (CNRS, INRAé, IRD), as well as engineering school (ENTPE, InstitutAgro 
Rennes -Angers), and the applied an d fundamental U. Gustave Eiffel . Very important for transfer to 
stakeholders,  a large team of  the CEREMA  participates in the project . CEREMA  is the public agency 
for developing and transferring  public expertise in the fields of planning, regional cohesion, and 
ecological and energy transit ion.  PEPR  VBDI

Each work package is led by two researchers from different disciplines and different cities to 
guarantee complementarity and exchange at all times of the project.  
WP1 deals with urban scale processes and is headed by Laure Vidal -Beaudet and Marc Bour geois.  
L. Vidal -Beaudet is professor of urban agronomy at the Institut Agro Rennes -Angers and a 
researcher at the EPHor lab. She has worked for over 25 yrs on urban soils functions and ecosystem 
services, and has developed innovative processes to construct  resilient and fertile soils for city 
renaturation. She is also a specialist in urban soil cartography ( https://pro.institut -agro-rennes -
angers.fr/fr/laure -vidal-beaudet ). M. Bourgeois  is assistant professor of geography at the Université 
Jean Moulin Lyon 3, and a researcher at the EVS lab. He is an expert in geomatics, and his work 
has focused on modeling landscape connectivity in urban, rural or road construction contexts  
(https://umr5600.cnrs.fr/fr/lequipe/name/marc -bourgeois/).  
WP2  is focused on plot -scale processes, and is headed by Marylise Cottet and Geoffroy Séré. M. 
Cottet  is CNRS social geographer at the EVS lab in Lyon, who documents how people perceive 
their envi ronments, using classical interview methods. In particular, she has worked on social, 
political and restoration issues in urban contexts  ( https://umr5600.cnrs.fr/fr/lequipe /name/marylise -
cottet -tronchere/ ). G. Séré  is professor at the Université de Lorraine, carries out his research on soil 
sciences at the LSE laboratory in Nancy, focusing on ecosystem services delivered by technosols 
in urban contexts( https://lse.univ -lorraine.fr/node/45 ).  
WP3  is headed by Emmanuelle Baudry and Eric Charmes.  E. Baudry  is Professor of Ecology at 
Paris Saclay University and member of UMR Ecologie, Systématique, Evolution (ESE). She is 
specialized in urban ecology, with a particular interest in the double role of parks and home gardens 
as biodiversity reservoirs and primary source of nature experience for urban dwellers. She studies 
the conditions for maintaining biodiversity in peri -urban areas, as well as the associated ecosystem 
services and the relationships that urban residents have with biodiversity 
(https://www.ese.universite -paris -saclay.fr/en/team -members/emmanuelle -baudry/). E. Charmes  is 
a senior researcher in social sciences a nd urban planning at the ENTPE (EVS lab, Lyon). He has 
studied public places, esp. streets of large cities, and is currently working on densification policies 
and the place of single -family housing ( https://umr5600.cnrs.fr/fr/lequipe/name/eric -charmes/ ).  
WP4  is headed by Béatrice Béchet and Bernard Kaufmann.  B. Béchet  is a senior researcher at the 
Université Gustave Eiffel in Nantes (LEE lab), she is the director of the research feder ation IRSTV, 
which regroups Western French CNRS, university and engineering schools labs working on the 
adaptation of cities to climate changes. She is a soil scientist studying the water -mediated mobility 
of pollutants in soils and subsoils ( https://pagespro.univ -gustave -eiffel.fr/beatrice -bechet ). B. 
Kaufmann is the project manager and is described in detail below.  
Tasks and task coordinators are listed in the Gantt diagram.  Stakeholders involved in 
VILLEGARDEN are described (expertise, interest and actions in WPs) in the dedicated annex. They 
include all types of urban actors – cities, agglomeration communities, métropoles, soc ial housing 
landlords, urban consulting agencies, private companies and associations. They are our partners 
over more than one past or current project. They will intervene in specified actions, and participate 
in the forums, which are meant to regroup all types of stakeholders from all cities, along with the 
academics.  
Six urban areas (Angers, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier, Nancy and Paris) with the largest teams have 
been selected to participate in the common effort to characterize 200 RGS in detail (Fig.2) . 
Depending on additional funding and stakeholder partners, this effort could be expanded to Nantes 
and Toulouse. Focused research actions can occur in different sites, e.g. permaculture will be 
studied in periurban situations detached from continuous urba n areas, where it has taken an early  PEPR  VBDI

hold thanks to larger plot sizes. Similarly, cultural influences on gardens and soils will also be studied 
in community gardens tha t offer a condensed study group (see Field sites table in the annex).  
As has already been detailed above, VILLEGARDEN seeks t o assess the performance of RGS, the 
factors that explain performance, the impact of RGS performance at the urban scale, and how to 
improve RGS functioning. Stakeholders are involved both in research (through shared field work, 
elaboration of methods and d iscussion of results) and in co -constructing tools and methods for their 
own practice. On the academic side of the project, scientists stem from four major disciplinary 
groups: ecologists working on biodiversity (microbes, arthropods, earthworms, plants, b irds, 
pollinators), soil scientists with different backgrounds (e.g. pollution, agronomy, ecosystem services, 
water -soil interface), social scientists (sociology, social geography and urban planning) and 
environmental geographers/geomaticians. As we intend  to replicate a large part of the study across 
6 urban areas, replication of part or all expertise acoss cities was necessary. Such a consortium will 
be able to pursue all the stated objectives.  But VILLEGARDEN also relies on a network of 
stakeholders (se e partners annex), with different kinds of expertise and raisins d’être. Cities, 
agglomeration communities and Métropoles where the 200 RGS assessment will be carried out are 
part of the effort, and will help with recruiting residents for the study. Social  housing landlords have 
also shown interest (e.g. in COLLECTIFS where 2 major actors gave access and support for 
ecological and social studies). A number of national and local associations will participate in 
VILLEGARDEN. Private companies, esp. landscape professionals are also part of the project. With 
the limited time to design VILLEGARDEN and its importance, it has been impossible to assign 
precise roles to each stakeholder partner, but we are all currently working with stakeholders on linked 
projects.  
3.3. Management framework  / Pilotage   
Project governance  will be assured by a project executive committee (PEC) composed of all 6 WP 
leaders and one person per partner institution. It will be presided by B. Béchet and B. Kaufmann and 
conducted by the (hired) pr oject coordinator. The PEC will meet regularly to ensure the project’s 
progress by sharing information on WPs, forums and linked projects. It will decide necessary 
changes to projected actions or expenses over its five -year course. The PEC will meet in p erson at 
least once a year during a project conference or workshop. The PEC will also once a year  convene 
general assemblies, either in -person during project conferences, or online whenever necessary, with 
all project participants including non -permanent  researchers  and research support personnel.  
Additionally, an external advisory board  (EAB) will be created to ensure high scientific standards 
along the duration of the project. It will be composed of three international researchers from different 
discip lines, one member of the PEPR VDBI direction, one head of a PEPR VDBI operational center , 
and three stakeholders (one from an association, another from a territorial unit,  and one person from 
ADEME - the French public funding and expertise organization on climate and environment). Our 
choice of three international scientists will need to be approved by t he PEPR VDBI team. The EAB 
will receive regular updates and be presented with an annual state of advances, based on the annual 
report due to the PEPR VDBI and the ANR.  
KPIs were chosen  to be easy to evaluate and share (Table 4). They will be upda ted twice a year, 
and shared openly online. Milestones are conferences, major completed tasks, sets of deliverables 
and scores at indicators. Their status (reached, provisional timing, or failed) will be shared openly 
online.  
The major risks  of the project  are i) the lack of replication of major tasks across field sites, ii) loss 
of interest in the general success of the project and focus on local subtasks, iii) loss of interest in 
conferences and workshops. Hiring a project coordinator is a major risk -limiting factor. The  PEPR  VBDI

 23 
coordinator will gather information from all teams for the shared website and the preparation of PEC 
and EAB sessions; this will ensure that all deviations from the project’s timeframe are detected early 
enough for course correction. Risk management will also consist in developing trust and strong links 
between the research teams, through the forums as well as the PEC and the general assemblies.  
Relationship with  PEPR  VDBI . The EAB defined above will feature a member o f the VDBI team as 
well as an operational centre leader. This will help steer the project in accordance and in full 
openness with the VDBI governance. The project manager and project leader will keep a steady flow 
of information toward the VDBI team. Addit ionally, the VDBI team and operational centers will be 
invited to participate in every conference and workshop of the project, and co -organize major events.  
As already explained, data generation is central to the project, and a strong connection to the 
operational center in Bordeaux will be indispensable for the project’s success. Spatial modeling of 
habitats and ecological connectivity, as well as experimental approaches (5 years survey of changes 
after biodiversity -positive action by stakeholders, experim ental survey of pollination success), will 
make work with the Lyon center very fruitful in both directions - esp. as M. Bourgeois (WP1) already 
works with the LabEx IMU and the Living’Lab Anthares in which V. Pueyo or L. Soulac are strongly 
involved. Urban  planning is the focus of tasks in WP1 as well as a forum again meaning that strong 
ties with the operational center at UGE should be made as soon as possible.  As indicated above, 
we intend to work closely with projects VF++, NEO  and SAGA -CITE  with which we share sites and 
with which complementarities are strong ( biodiversity + climate modeling + soil hydrology + air 
pollution modeling) . 
3.4. Institutional strategy / Stratégie des établissements   
Fourteen national and local higher education and research institutions will be funded in 
VILLEGARDEN. The French HER system is characterized by having basic units  (laboratories or 
UMR) mixing researchers from different local and national institutions. Funds from projects like 
VILLEGARDEN are managed by one institution per lab. This means that far more institutions are 
involved in the project than is apparent. It wo uld be impossible and rather pointless to give 
institutional strategies for all of them. All universities and engineering schools seek to join in 
innovative research initiatives, to benefit their labs and their students, who will participate as inte rns, 
phDs or follow courses and field activities generated by the project. Close relationships with local 
stakeholders are also strongly encouraged. National operators, such as CNRS  and INRAé, fund and 
support re search on cities and environments, through research federations (here IRSTV and 
BIOEENVIS), experimental facilities or directly to laboratories. CNRS is also one of the PEPR VDBI 
institutional leaders with UGE. UGE  is the leading institution in urban and transport studies in France, 
and has close ties with multiple stakeholders. CEREMA is an original research actor on 
environmental questions , which acts as a link between the national and local levels of authorities, 
from the drafting of regulations to their  actual implementation, from academic res earch to operational 
innovation . The managing institution for VILLEGARDEN is the Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 
which, with other HER institutions in Lyon , has built up a major research hub in urban studies, with 
the BIOEENVIS research federation, the LabEx IMU, PEPR VBDI (direction and OC), PEPR SOLU -
BIOD (direction and Living Lab), the EUR H2OLYON, and the SHAPE -med@Lyon initiative 
investigating territorial aspects of global health. VILLEGARDEN will endeavor to connect all these 
institutions and laboratories to construct a national community on urban sustainability from the 
perspective of ecosystem service i n residential areas, which all institutions can valorize for research, 
teaching and communication.  All our institutions strongly support PEPR projects , with possible 
additional funding  for events  organization and for research .  PEPR  VBDI

4. Expected outcomes of the project / Impact et retombées du projet  
The m ain outcome of VILLEGARDEN  is a new, data -grounded vision of residential greenspaces for 
urban planners and citizens alike. This will help define major planning regulations such as z ero-net 
artificialization (ZAN) . More than half of French people live in single -family homes with gardens (23% 
of households in Métropole de Lyon) and most (82% of households, 63% of residences) of those 
living in multifamily housing have RGS (%  from the COLLECTIFS project). The impacts of the 
present project could therefore be massive, depending on how these spaces contribute to urban 
livability at plot to urban scales. In addition, the project will provide new benchmarks for biodiversity 
and soils. Furthermore, directly working with stakeholders will ensure that the proje ct has a direct 
impact on ideologies and practices. The future of French cities will depend on choosing the right 
planning alternatives in a situation of certain but unpredictable environmental change. 
VILLEGARDEN will co -construct with urban planners, lan dscape professionals, associations and 
citizens solid data and models which can optimize the use of RGS at all scales . VILLEGARDEN is 
built around a community of academics  who have worked with stakeholders for decades. Our 
partner s demand interaction, either direct during meetings and workshops. This is  one of  the reaso n 
for the three f orums of the project. They are designed  to act as exchange hubs between and among 
academics and stakeholders.  Among VILLEGARDEN’s academic partners, the CEREMA is a 
specialized institution whose main role is to advise public actors through the production of decision -
making tools or through direct expertise. One VILLEGARDEN IE/IR with the CER EMA will solely be 
devoted to co -construction of tools and guides for public actors. As our project relies on residents of 
single or multifamily housing, we will make all methods, results and analysis available to the public, 
following the examples of the project COLLECTIFS ( https://collectifs -biodiversite.universite -lyon.fr/ ) 
and qubs ( https://www.qubs.fr/ ). A truly national project like VILLEGAR DEN (field sites, researchers 
and stakeholders from 9 urban areas), with at least one event per year for 5 years, will promote the 
PEPR VDBI for stakeholders and academics alike.  
A data management plan  following the recommendations of the ANR will be established during the 
first year of the project, with a hired data scientist  for the duration of the project. This will be done in 
accordance with the PEPR VDBI OC on data. The data scientist  will ensure that all data and results 
will be store d safely in the French public repository for biodiversity and environmental data at 
dataterra -theia ( https://www.data -terra.org/en/data -hubs -cross -cutting -structures/theia/) as soon as 
they are completed and verifi ed. Analyzed results will be published on the project’s website prior to 
scientific publication.  The project website will feature the detailed but popularized results and 
analyses of the project.  Conferences and workshops will all lead to synthetic documents, to 
dedicated reports or to meetings abstracts. Books will have a digital version, although it is impossible 
to guarantee free and open access at this point.  
VILLEGARDEN is designed to last 5 years and to give rise to spinoff projects. The large number of 
participants  means that there will be both incentives and volunteers  to make the project grow, either 
by finding additional funding locally, or by expanding to other national or European funding calls. The 
synergy with other VDBI projects or with PEPR SOLUBIOD Living  Labs will increase the impact of 
VILLEGARDEN on both academic institutions and on stakeholders . 
5. Funding justification / Justification des moyens demandés  
The support demanded by VILLEGARDEN reaches 3 m€, the upper limit of the PEPR VDBI call. 
This stems from the sheer size of the community that is involved in the project (14 labs, over 80 
people). It should be noted that while 3 m€ is a large sum, the perso nnel costs invested by the 
research institutions in VILLEGARDEN are over 3m€, to which 3.5m€ of environment (e.g. lab space,  PEPR  VBDI  
APPEL À PROJETS  
2023  
 DOCUMENT PRESENTATION  PROJET  
 
VILLEGARDEN  
 
 25 
field & lab & office equipment, fluids) must be added. The proposed total budget reaches 9.5m€. 
This is not counting the linked pro jects.  
Community building and animation was one of the call’s objectives. Outreach to stakeholders and 
other scientific communities was another priority. Our funding choices (Fig. 3) reflects these 
priorities, as coordination (5yr coordinator), animation, mobility and events amount to a third of the 
demand (0.8m€), plus data management and GIS (5yr data scientist, 0.25m€). A second, larger third 
is devoted to all aspects (incl. social and geographic) of the 200 RGS characterization, the main 
action of the p roposal. A smaller third will fund focused research actions on specific points of the 
RGS that cannot be solved using a 
systematic approach. All partners 
will have funds for mobility to 
VILLEGARDEN and PEPR VDBI 
events (see Financial Annex).

paradox: tipping points for the operational 
reconciliation of dense and green morphologies. 
submitted to NPJ Sustainability . Preprint at 
https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs -
3551977/v1  Combining very high resolution mapping with cadastral data 
on >11000 m ultifamily residential units, we show that 
sustainable greening supporting biodiversity is compatible 
with higher urban densities. This can be achieved by slightly 
higher buildings and better designed non -built spaces.

multiple scales, from the local metric scale to the broad 
landscape and regional scales.

everybody else: urbanization factors shaping spatial 
distribution of native and invasive ants are species -
specific. Urban Ecosystems, 20: 157 –169. Show s that different species, even within a same genus, 
respond differently to different urban landscape factors, 
indicating that urbanization is not a single process, but 
represents many different environmental changes.
