Based on the text, the relevant disciplines are:

1. **Geochemistry**: Studies the chemical composition and processes that occur in the Earth's crust.
2. **Ecology**: Examines the relationships between organisms and their environment, including the interactions between species and their habitats.
3. **Soil Science** (Pedology): Investigates the physical, chemical, biological, and mineralogical properties of soil and its role in ecosystems.
4. **Environmental Science**: Concerned with understanding and mitigating the impact of human activities on the environment.
5. **Agriculture**: The study of agriculture and rural development, including urban agriculture.
6. **Toxicology** (Ecotoxicology): Investigates the adverse effects of environmental pollutants on living organisms.

These disciplines are interconnected, as they all relate to understanding the complex relationships between natural and human-induced factors that affect ecosystems, soil quality, and human health.
