The Villegarden project is a research and development project that aims to improve the management of urban green spaces (GRS) and promote sustainable urban planning. The project focuses on evaluating the performance of different types of GRS systems, such as individual and multifamily homes, and identifying factors that affect their performance.

According to [1], the Villegarden project is part of a larger initiative to develop effective policies for biodiversity and permeability in cities. The project's objectives include evaluating the performance of GRS systems, identifying factors that affect their performance, and developing tools and models to optimize their use.

The project also aims to address the issue of artificialization in urban areas, which can lead to a loss of green spaces and ecosystem services. According to [10], artificialization is defined as "the alteration of all or part of a soil's ecological functions, including its biological, hydraulic, climatic, and agronomic potential".

The Villegarden project is expected to provide new references for biodiversity and soil management, which will be essential for the future of French cities. According to [8], the project will co-construct with urban planners, landscape professionals, associations, and citizens to develop solid data and models that can optimize the use of GRS at all scales.

In summary, the Villegarden project is a research and development initiative that aims to improve the management of urban green spaces and promote sustainable urban planning. The project focuses on evaluating the performance of different types of GRS systems, identifying factors that affect their performance, and developing tools and models to optimize their use.
